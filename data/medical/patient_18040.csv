**Vital Signs and Observations:**  
- **Oxygen Saturation (SaO2):** Maintained above 93% on nasal cannula at 150cc flow.  
- **Respiratory Rate:** Fluctuates between 40-70 breaths per minute. Clear lung sounds with mild nasal stuffiness. No respiratory spells or desaturation events noted.  
- **Heart Rate:** No bradycardia observed.  
- **Medications and Treatments:** Continuation of oxygen therapy; Lasix administered every other day and other prescribed treatments.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
1. Ongoing need for 100% oxygen via nasal cannula with assessment for weaning in future.  
2. Monitor feeding status on ad lib basis with 24-hour intake of 120cc/kg/day, ensuring weight gain and nutritional stability.  
3. Monitor for developmental progress and skin integrity with potential for loose stool redness.  
4. Family involvement in care and discharge planning, including CPR training for family members.

**Nursing Notes:** Continuation of monitoring throughout the day shift with additional assessments as necessary."
