**Respiratory Status:**
- Respiratory Rate: 40-50 breaths per minute, mild subcostal retractions.
- Oxygen Saturation (SaO2): Baseline in high 80s-low 90s; desaturation drops to low 80s and 70s during feeds, requiring supplemental O2.
- Supplemental Oxygen: Required during feeding, maintaining SaO2 in low 90s with nasal cannula O2 at 25cc.

**Medications:**
- Diuril (hydrochlorothiazide)
- KCl (potassium chloride)

**Nutritional Intake:**
- Feeding: Minimum of 130cc/kg/day of BM28; continues every 4 hours.
- Abdomen: Benign, no distension, voiding well, 90cc bottled at 9 AM.
- Spitting: 2 medium-sized spits observed today.

**Plans:**
- Continue monitoring respiratory status closely and providing supplemental O2 as needed.
- Consider discharge with home O2.
- Follow-up eye exam scheduled."
