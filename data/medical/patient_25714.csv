- Diminished breath sounds with coarse crackles; monitored for airway issues.
- High-frequency suctioning for bloody secretions noted; worsening condition observed.
- Heart rate is regular at 130-150 bpm with increased incidents of bradycardia.

**Plan and Monitoring:**
- Continue to monitor respiratory status closely; schedule tracheostomy on Tuesday.
- Administer Combivent for bronchial management; suctioning performed approximately every hour.
- Investigate for possible infection based on elevated agitation and lability. Complete blood count (CBC) and cultures obtained.

2189-02-14,51.68,154.8,95.2,48.391304347826086,"**Respiratory Rate:**  
- Patient intubated on IMV settings: 22/5 cm H2O, respiratory rate between 30 to 70 breaths per minute.  
- Typical desaturation events drop into the 50s and 60s, requiring manual ventilation and adjustment of oxygen.

**Heart Rate:**  
- Ranges from 30s to 70s bpm, averaged at 101 bpm during assessment.

**SaO2:**  
- Oxygen saturation fluctuates, with noted desaturation occurrences requiring intervention; levels drop to 30-60% frequently. 

**FiO2:**  
- Current FiO2 settings range between 35% to 60%, with plans for optimization during ongoing care.

**Other Observations:**  
- Moderate amounts of thick secretions are managed with frequent suctioning every 1-3 hours.
- CBG results indicate acid-base imbalance: pH 7.34, pCO2 70, pO2 95.
- Patient on current antibiotic regimen for infection management and Lasix for fluid control.  
- Echocardiogram scheduled to evaluate cor pulmonale due to respiratory issues. 

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring respiratory and cardiac parameters closely.
- Follow up on culture results and patient’s response to treatments.
- Prepare for tracheostomy scheduled for the upcoming days."
