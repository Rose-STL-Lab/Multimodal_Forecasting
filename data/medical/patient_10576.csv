  - Regular rate and rhythm (RRR), no murmurs, well-perfused.
  - Occasional spontaneous bradycardia during feeds.

**Assessment and Plan:**
1. **Respiratory Assessment:**
   - Oxygen saturation levels greater than 94%; monitoring required.
   - Noted desaturation episodes with feeds but no supplemental oxygen needed.

2. **Feeding:**
   - Current feeding: 50-120cc with some signs of gulping during initiation.
   - Tolerating a 24-calorie formula; continuing prune juice for digestion.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Continue to observe respiratory status, feeding, and developmental progress. Adjust care as needed."

- Infant: [**Known lastname**]
- Age: Neonate 

**Vital Signs:**
- Respiratory Rate: 30-50 breaths per minute, increasing to 40-60 during feeding.
- Oxygen Saturation (SaO2): 95-98% in room air; maintaining >94% with mild oxygen requirements during feeds.
- FiO2: Required 100% via nasal cannula (NC) at 25cc during feedings.

**Respiratory Status:**
- Mild subcostal retractions observed.
- Mild upper airway congestion noted; no significant respiratory distress.
- Ongoing monitoring for Apnea of Prematurity (AOP) and bradycardia during feeding episodes.

**Cardiovascular Status:**
- Regular rhythm and rate, no murmurs, well perfused.

**Feeding and Nutrition:**
- Total Fluid Intake: 200cc/kg/day.
- Feeding schedule: SC24; typically 100-105cc every 4 hours.
- Weight: 2980g (gain of 45g).

**Plan:**
- Continue current management with ongoing monitoring of respiratory status and bradycardic events.
- Next eye exam scheduled for Wednesday."

- Corrected Gestational Age (CGA) 39 weeks

**Respiratory Status:**
- On room air, clear lung sounds
- Respiratory rate: 40-50 breaths per minute
- O2 saturation maintained above 95% during feedings with nasal cannula at 100% oxygen as needed
- Mild subcostal retractions noted, no spontaneous spells

**Heart Rate:**
- Notable drifts observed during initial oral feedings, self-resolving quickly
- Hemodynamically stable with no murmurs

**Feeding Status:**
- Tolerating ad libitum oral feeds, no spitting
- Feeding volume: 170 cc/kg/day
- Requires low oxygen due to frequent bradycardia during feeds
- Abdomen soft, round, active bowel sounds, voiding observed

**Clinical Status:**
- Temperature stable, awake and alert, sleeping well
- No abnormal spells during the shift

**Impression:**
- Former 24-week infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and feeding immaturity, overall doing well but experiencing frequent spells during feeding.

**Plan:**
- Continue monitoring respiratory status, adjust care as needed, maintain O2 saturation above 94%
- Schedule eye examination this week
- Ongoing assessment of feeding tolerance and adjustments"
