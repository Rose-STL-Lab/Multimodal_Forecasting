**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Time:** [Insert Time]  

**Vital Signs:**
- **Respiratory Rate (RR):** 30-50 breaths per minute
- **Heart Rate:** Not specifically documented
- **Oxygen Saturation (SaO2):** 94-100% in room air; maintained at or above 93%
- **Supplemental Oxygen (FiO2):** Requires 100% via nasal cannula (NC) during feedings at 50 cc

**Observations:**
- Mild upper airway congestion observed, with mild intermittent subcostal retractions.
- Clear bilateral breath sounds, no stridor present.
- Desaturation events occurred during feeding: dropped to 82% then improved after bottle removal.
- Coordination during afternoon feeding improved, no desaturation events noted.
- Signs of fatigue during feeding; continues to require monitoring for feeding tolerance and respiratory status.

**Assessment:**
- Stable respiratory and feeding status overall, being monitored for growth and developmental needs.
- Recent weight: 3015 grams, increased by 75 grams.
  
**Plan:**
- Continue respiratory support and close observation of feeding.
- Monitor for aspiration signs and adjust feeding plan as needed.
- Referral for swallow study if feeding difficulties persist."
