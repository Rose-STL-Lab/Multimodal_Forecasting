**Heart Rate:**
- Heart sounds normal (S1S2), no murmurs appreciated.
  
**Oxygen Saturation (SaO2):**
- Oxygen saturation maintained effectively with current respiratory support.
  
**Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2):**
- Patient receiving 100% FiO2 via nasal cannula; ongoing assessment required.

**Summary:**
- Patient is stable with good ABG results.
