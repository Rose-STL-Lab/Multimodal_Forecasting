- Received infant in nasal cannula at 100% O2, 13cc flow; trialing room air since 2107 with no spells observed.
- Respiratory rate between 30-40 breaths per minute; occasional oxygen saturation drifts, infant recovers quickly; mild subcostal retractions noted on room air.
- Periodic breathing observed; cluster of bradycardias during the 1200 bottle feed; refer to flowsheet for details of apnea/bradycardia episodes.
- Plan: Continue monitoring for respiratory distress.

**Cardiovascular Status:**
- Regular heart rate and rhythm, no murmur reported.

**Oxygenation:**
- Currently on room air, occasional monitoring of SaO2; no significant alterations noted.

**Medications:**
- Continues on diuretic (Diuril) and potassium chloride (KCl); monitoring ongoing.

**Plan Summary:**
