Significant cold outbreaks on January 3-4 and 5-8 could result in temperatures 20-30 degrees Fahrenheit below normal. Lows in New England may reach -10s to -20s, and areas in eastern Montana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin may experience lows at or below -20F. Colder locations could drop to -30s or -40s Fahrenheit. Moderate upslope snow is anticipated across east-facing slopes from Montana to Northeast Wyoming. The coldest day is projected around January 8, with temperatures below freezing in a large section of the northern United States, potentially marking the coldest air masses since 1993/1994.

Precipitation is expected from a frontal zone moving across the Midwest and East on Sunday and Monday, followed by lake effect snows from late Monday into Wednesday. Radiational cooling could contribute to extremely low temperatures in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic states. The Gold Coast of Florida will remain slightly above normal, with temperatures struggling to drop below 60°F. 

The western region will experience milder weather, with parts of the Great Basin and Southwest being 10+ degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Light to moderate precipitation is likely across the Pacific Northwest into the Northern and Central Rockies Tuesday and Wednesday, with potential for a Santa Ana event in Southern California.

2014-01-15,42.4,0.002,81.0,21.2,"Temperatures are expected to remain above normal in the West, with variable conditions in the East. A dry pattern is anticipated in the West, while precipitation may occur in the Great Lakes and Gulf Coast due to mid-level shortwaves and frontal passages. Low pressure could develop offshore impacting the East Coast late in the period. Shortwaves moving south and east into the Atlantic may enhance rainfall, but specifics remain unclear. The GFS/GEFS models are slightly faster than the ECMWF, UKMET, and Canadian models, with better continuity seen in the ECMWF-led cluster. Attention should be given to a potentially cutoff low near 35N/140W, though significant eastward movement is unlikely due to a strong upper ridge in place. Uncertainties in model predictions persist through the medium range."
2014-01-16,37.3,0.0,52.7,15.2,"A stable ridge/trough pattern persists over Vancouver Island and Southeastern Ontario. Significant variability exists in the Pacific Northwest and Western Atlantic. Positive 500mb height anomalies remain near +2. A preferred model cluster includes ECMWF, UKMET, and ECENS mean. Troughing in the Pacific affects the ridging to the east, with energy potentially splitting north-south. Weaker energy may move toward the Gulf of Alaska. A ridge along the West Coast is likely to maintain or strengthen, influencing mid-level patterns in the Rockies. A northern stream clipper system will impact the East, with potential low-pressure development offshore. The West stays warm with record high temperatures likely, while eastern temperatures trend cooler. Rain and snow are mainly confined to the Great Lakes/Northeast and Gulf Coast, with most weather systems expected to remain offshore."
2014-01-17,38.8,0.002,63.9,11.0,"The medium range forecast from January 20 to January 24, 2014, will feature strong ridging over western Canada and longwave troughing in the eastern U.S. Above-normal high temperatures are expected west of the continental divide, while central, eastern, and southeastern states will see below-normal temperatures (10-20°F below climatological averages) due to an Arctic push. There is less potential for eastern coastal storms than previously indicated. Temperatures in parts of the southeast and southern plains are projected to rebound modestly by the end of the week. Light wintry precipitation may occur along a storm track influenced by mid-level warm advection, but overall precipitation amounts will be minimal, rarely exceeding 1/10th of an inch. Humidity levels will be low, with precipitable water values below climatological averages, contributing to a dry mid-winter pattern across most of the continental U.S."
2014-01-18,31.7,0.0,50.3,18.4,"A highly-amplified ridge/trough pattern will persist, with embedded shortwaves affecting the weather. A blend of ECMWF and GFS models suggests a possible quick intrusion of northern stream energy into Minnesota late Thursday. A weak closed low will approach the CA/OR border late Wednesday into early Thursday under the northern ridge. A cold blast of Arctic air will move through the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes, with temperatures forecasted to be 10-20°F below climatological average in the eastern half of the CONUS. Higher probabilities of wintry precipitation are expected in the Great Lakes, Appalachians, and Northeast, with light mid-level warm advection processes limited to storm tracks from the Northern Plains through the Midwest to the Ohio Valley. Offshore cyclogenesis is favored, while precipitation in coastal areas will be low due to an off-shore flow pattern. The upper ridge may allow for record high temperatures in some areas, but overall precipitation chances remain limited. In Oregon and Washington, an intense subsidence inversion is causing persistent fog and stratus layers, inhibiting warmer temperatures; a cold core low is anticipated to disrupt this pattern in the coming days. Humidity levels are expected to be high due to the persistent fog."

A series of mid-level clipper waves will bring winter precipitation from the Northern Plains to the Great Lakes, Appalachians, and Northeast. An Arctic surge will move southward, significantly dropping temperatures in the southern and southeastern states. An Arctic boundary will affect the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions this Sunday. A well-organized clipper low will bring cold conditions and high pressure across the Central and Eastern US from Monday to Wednesday. Significant Arctic blast is anticipated, impacting temperatures and precipitation, with possible weather developments off the East Coast. The forecast is based on a composite model blend of GFS, GEFS, ECMWF, and ECMWF ensemble mean, emphasizing reduced forecast spread and increased ECMWF weighting mid-week."

The west will remain dry and mild due to a ridge pattern, while the northeast may experience snowfall in northern Minnesota. Daytime convection is likely in the southeastern U.S. to the mid-Atlantic, with a risk of severe weather on Tuesday. Precipitable water values are expected to exceed 1.0 inch, with concentrations over 1.5 inches north of 40N. Additional rainfall is anticipated in the southern Appalachians and mid-Atlantic due to high moisture levels before the front passes. Expect average daily temperatures in the eastern U.S. to be below normal, particularly maximum temperatures, while minimums may remain near or above average. Light precipitation and diurnally-driven showers are forecast post-frontal, with the potential for additional rainfall in the Gulf Coast depending on high pressure movements."

Precipitation is expected to track from the Great Lakes/Northeast into Friday, while lingering deep moisture and localized heavier convective activity will affect the Southeast this week. Unseasonably cold air will bring modest precipitation across the Northern Tier, developing into unsettled weather across the Northwestern US next weekend into early next week. Ensemble mean guidance shows improving clustering in the forecast."
2014-04-29,50.5,1.143,85.6,15.7,"Models predict a decrease in the amplitude of the 500 mb trough in the east as a closed low progresses northeast into the Canadian Maritimes by May 5. Following this, a high amplitude ridge is anticipated to build across the Northern Plains and Mississippi Valley, while uncertainty remains regarding the West Coast trough's amplitude. The ECMWF ensemble shows less amplification compared to the GEFS members, which suggest higher amplitude development in California on May 6. An intermediate model solution has been used to address discrepancies. Additionally, predictions indicate that the resolution of the climate system will be influenced by Typhoon Tapah's extratropical transition. The latest ECMWF model indicates reduced likelihood of southern stream wave development near the Southeast Coast, with increased focus on a dominant northern stream low impacting Ontario and Quebec instead."
2014-04-30,57.8,2.716,90.7,14.1,"A low amplitude atmospheric pattern will amplify, bringing a deep trough over the western United States and ridging into the east-central states.

A broad area of precipitation is projected from northern-central parts of the west into the northern plains, and eventually the upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes, with snow levels decreasing as the upper trough settles. Light rainfall and possibly isolated snow are expected in northern regions, while Florida could experience locally moderate-heavy rainfall. Temperatures in the central-southern Rockies and plains may exceed normal by 15-20°F, possibly reaching daily record highs, but northern areas will see daytime highs 5-15°F below normal as the weekend progresses and the trough amplifies.

After Monday, confidence in details decreases, leading to a forecast for days 5-7 based on a blend of models. Key uncertainties involve the evolution of mid-level energy affecting the northeast and surface low pressure, with potential variations in the strength and track of the low pressure system in the central plains. 

Precipitation is expected to be highest in favored terrains of the Northwest, northern high plains, eastern slopes of the Rockies, and the Upper Mississippi Valley due to warm advection. Temperatures in the central and southern plains may reach 15-20°F above normal from Sunday to Tuesday, with some locations approaching record highs. A vigorous surface low will cross New England Sunday night, generating varying intensities of rainfall. A stalled front may focus areas of rainfall next week, and convection may develop over the central-southern plains by Thursday.

High temperatures may reach 15-20°F above normal in the central/south-central plains during Tuesday and Wednesday, with warming spreading eastward but with lesser anomalies.

Precipitation is expected to generate a broad area of rain, particularly in the northern Rockies and northern plains, with enhanced totals due to low-level upslope flow; some precipitation may fall as snow in higher elevations. A warm front associated with low pressure moving northeast will generate localized rainfall, especially in southern plains and mid-Mississippi Valley, potentially resulting in multiple inches due to a moisture feed from the western Gulf.

Confidence in the operational ECMWF model is low, particularly for predicting below normal temperatures in the northern Rockies. In the eastern US, a deep layer trough will bring higher pressure across the Great Lakes. Discrepancies arise as another longwave trough approaches the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes; GFS models are outliers with a stronger surface low inconsistent for this time of year. A blend of model outputs is used for more reliable forecasting. Expect wet conditions across the central and adjacent southern plains, while dry weather will persist in southern Texas and along the Gulf Coast."

Potential heavy rains of several inches are expected from a convective complex centered on Kansas/Missouri, extending into Oklahoma/Arkansas. The GFS and ECMWF models exhibit inconsistencies but indicate significant rainfall potential. A flat pattern is anticipated for days 6-7, with a 500 mb trough in the northern plains forecasted around June 10. Ensemble member variations suggest low confidence in the outcome, with uncertainty in the trough's speed and position. In the West, model predictions vary, with the Canadian model and its ensembles appearing more amplified, while the ECMWF mean is flatter. Teleconnections suggest west coast trough development, supported by the GEFS and NAEFS mean forecasts. A closed anticyclone is positioned over the western Gulf Coast and northern Mexico, drifting west, with a potential weakness or trough developing in the Southeast to the Gulf Coast early next week, more clearly depicted by the GEFS model."

A cooling trend will begin by Wednesday, with inland temperatures falling into the lower 90s by Thursday. A blocking ridge near the Davis Strait and retrograding ridging over the NE Pacific will create a buckled zonal flow over the continental U.S., keeping active weather across the central and eastern states through midweek. A stalled frontal boundary is anticipated over the Mid-Atlantic and Central Appalachians, while a cold front moving through Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley is expected to weaken. Thunderstorm activity and potentially severe weather may occur along the southern fringes of the northern airmass, particularly in the Midwest, Ohio Valley, and the Appalachians. Heavy rainfall is a potential risk, driven by an influx of Gulf moisture and PW values of +1 to +2. A well-defined system is expected to move into Washington/Oregon on Thursday."

Medium to larger scale flow has better clustering, while uncertainties regarding smaller scale features and convection remain. The overall flow features cooling mid-upper level troughs in the western US, leading to cooling trends. Summer warming is expected in the eastern and southeastern US as a mid-upper level ridge builds. Heavy snowfall is likely in the northern Rockies, with strong convection and organized storms in the north-central states due to frontal passages. Less activity is anticipated further south near a persistent dryline.

Days 3 and 4 (June 15-16) are expected to have reasonable weather predictability, while days 5-7 (June 17-19) show greater uncertainty due to differing models regarding mid-upper level trough energy. The primary models suggest either a progressive movement through the mid-continent or a more amplified trough in the western U.S. This may lead to locally heavy snowfall in the northern Rockies and organized strong convection in the north-central states. Warming in the eastern, southern, and southeastern U.S. is expected, with locally heavy rains mainly affecting the central Gulf Coast states. Wind conditions will vary due to these developments."

Two closed vortices will affect precipitation patterns, with potential heavy rains and thunderstorms expected from the northern plains through the upper Midwest to the mid-Atlantic coast late this week and into the weekend. A compact upper low will move northeast within the ridge, progressing toward the Great Lakes/Upper Midwest by Sunday. Localized variations are anticipated due to a deep surface cyclone and trailing cold front impacting the Midwest and central plains. An increase in deep moisture will support heightened shower and thunderstorm activity, particularly in the Rockies/High Plains, within a warm and unstable airmass focused along an east-west oriented frontal boundary. Model guidance shows moderate agreement with these trends, despite some variability with the ECMWF model."

2014-06-25,81.2,0.455,71.8,13.6,"A broad subtropical ridge will dominate the southern tier, while a heavy rain threat is expected for the upper Midwest this weekend into early next week. A series of Pacific systems and cold fronts will move across southern Canada, impacting weather in the upper Midwest. The GFS and ECMWF models show good agreement for days 3-4, with some smaller-scale discrepancies noted. By day 5, notable differences emerge, particularly in east central Manitoba regarding the 500mb circulation cutoff. The GFS predicts an earlier cutoff compared to the Canadian model, while the ECMWF suggests a continuous wave pattern.

Weather impacts for days 6-7 will largely depend on convective initiation and propagation, with negligible Gulf of Mexico influences. A slower evolution of the cutoff system is forecasted for northern/central Florida. A lead system is organizing over southern central Canada, with broad southwest flow influencing the upper Midwest. The cold front will slowly progress over Minnesota and Iowa, creating a potential for heavy rain from Saturday to Monday due to high moisture and instability (CAPE values of 1000-2000 J/KG and PW values of +1 to +2 standard deviations). 

Temperatures are expected to be near to above normal in the central Plains, with highs reaching 5-10°F above climatological norms in the southwestern states.

An active weather pattern is anticipated in the eastern parts of the Northern and Central Continental Divide due to two Pacific systems bringing cold fronts across the US/Canadian border. A defined 500mb closed low is expected to form over Southern Canada by Sunday, leading to cooler temperatures in the Upper Midwest next week and a heavy rainfall threat due to a lingering frontal boundary over MN/IA/NE. 

The Southern Plains, Southwest, and Southeast will experience rising temperatures with triple-digit heat, especially in the Rio Grande Valley and mid to upper 90s in the Lower Mississippi Valley and Alabama/Florida Panhandle, contributing to oppressive heat indices. Precipitation is likely across most Northern Tier states with the possibility of deep convection in the Central Plains, Ozarks, and Upper Portions of the Missouri and Mississippi Valleys.

A significant cooldown is forecasted for the Dakotas and Great Lakes regions due to a secondary cold front moving southeast into the St. Lawrence Valley and Northern New England by late in the period. Humidity levels will be elevated in the Lower Mississippi Valley and Alabama/Florida Panhandle, exacerbating heat conditions, while the Desert Southwest will experience a notable heat event with dangerous heat indices."

Very hot conditions are expected, especially under the upper-level ridge in the Southwest, with temperatures 5-10°F above normal, particularly in California due to thermal trough effects. Precipitation predictability is low across the Midwest, Mid-Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Appalachia due to warm-sector convection. 

The GFS model indicates temperatures in the Great Lakes region will be 2-2.5 standard deviations below normal, migrating eastward, while the ECMWF suggests temperatures 1 standard deviation below normal over Lake Superior. A deep cyclone will move through Southern Canada and the Great Lakes, generating two cold fronts. The first front will advance toward the Ohio Valley and Ozarks, decaying along the subtropical ridge, while a secondary Canadian airmass will deliver drier air to the Northeast by the end of the forecast period.

A cooling surface front will move from the northeast Pacific to the western and northwestern US, dropping temperatures in these areas. Heavy convection is anticipated between the north-central and eastern US from Tuesday to Saturday, increasing precipitation levels due to deep moisture. Humidity levels will rise where heavy convection occurs. Limited rainfall is expected in favored terrains, with potential moisture influx into the southwest and south-central Rocky Mountains. Guidance shows mixed predictions for a possible hybrid low off the southeastern US, impacting convection with limited predictability. A mid-level trough will influence the eastern US later next week, with no substantial changes forecasted for the lower 48 states. A disturbance near the southeastern coast at coordinates 30N 78W will be monitored, influenced by mid-latitude troughs and an amplifying ridge near 110W.

A stable upper-level ridge will adjust eastward, with a temporary onshore flow in the Northwest as the ridge recovers over the Great Basin. A frontal passage is expected through the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, likely leading to precipitation in those areas. Drier air from the northwest will decrease humidity levels, particularly along the I-95 corridor. Day 5 and Day 6 forecast a transition to drier weather in the eastern third of the U.S., with high pressure settling in. Meanwhile, the western region may experience little change as the Pacific front dissipates. Warm to hot temperatures will return to the Great Basin as high pressure builds, leading to a return of normal temperatures in that region."

A low pressure system off the southeast coast has an 80% chance of development and may deepen as it moves toward South Carolina and North Carolina, creating variability in weather conditions along the east coast, particularly around the 4th of July. The eastern trough is expected to bring precipitation, especially in the I-95 corridor from Virginia to New York. Central U.S. will experience a cooling trend with fall-like temperatures due to a high-pressure system, while southern regions will see a later warming trend as summer returns. The western U.S. will remain active, with light to moderate rain expected due to an anomalous jet impacting Washington and convection affecting conditions."

A cold front will cross the Northern Tier, bringing potential strong winds and heavy rainfall near the East Coast from Arthur. A brief period of below normal temperatures, with minimums around -10°F, is expected early Saturday, followed by a return to warmer air after the weekend. The cold front may lead to several days of convection with locally heavy rainfall in the Northern Tier, Central Plains, Ohio Valley, and Northeast. Very warm to hot conditions are likely in the Northern High Plains on Saturday and the North-Central Plains on Sunday, with overall above normal temperatures for the Western CONUS. Diurnal convection is forecasted over the Central-Southern Rockies/Southwest, and likely periods of convection are anticipated in Florida and parts of the Southeast, possibly focused by a weakening front near Northern Florida."

Generally wet conditions will prevail from the lower Mississippi Valley northeastward toward the Appalachians and East Coast, with moderate to heavy rains likely, particularly early in the period. High confidence is noted in the southern tier, while low confidence is observed in the Northwest due to an evolving blocking pattern. The preferred models indicate a slightly faster weather progression, favoring the 00Z ECMWF ensemble mean. Timing and rain amounts are challenging to forecast because of weakening frontal boundaries. Cooler-than-expected temperatures may occur in the Pacific Northwest by day 7 if the 00Z ECMWF verifies."

An upper low will develop near the California coast, moving inland by Tuesday. There is high uncertainty regarding trough energy approaching the Pacific Northwest. A compact upper low is expected to reinforce weaknesses near the west coast, and ridging may develop in the Pacific Northwest by the end of the period. 

Significant weather changes are possible in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes due to strong dynamics aloft, with a front impacting weather by Thursday. There is considerable ensemble spread for low pressure systems expected to track offshore along the East Coast, with the ECMWF indicating a more offshore path.

Periods of convection are likely from the Interior West through the Rockies, particularly associated with the upper low from the California coast and diurnal convection in the Four Corners region.

A frontal passage will occur along the East Coast, while upper-level systems move west to east across the continent. The forecast indicates potential for increased tropical moisture and mid-level instability in Kansas and Missouri along the I-70 corridor. The ECMWF model is the slowest, emphasizing energy from the 250mb jet into the north-central Rockies, whereas the Canadian and UKMET models suggest increased Gulf moisture. There will be a decrease in humidity as a less humid air mass moves into the southeastern states before the central plains and upper Great Lakes experience increased precipitation chances days 3-5.

Early next week, the GFS model suggests a slower, more amplified setup in the west, with an upper-level front moving along the Appalachians and energy pushing northeast toward Maine and Nova Scotia. Subtropical moisture from Baja California and the western Gulf of Mexico may bring precipitation to California's coast. A 40% probability of a closed low developing exists, impacting subtropical moisture flow into the Great Basin and complicating the medium-range forecast. Additionally, a weakness in the subtropical ridge is expected in the southern plains, with effects from the 'Dolly' tropical plume noted in the mid-Rio Grande Valley. Showers and storms will concentrate across the Ohio Valley, with a moderate-intensity surface cyclone tracking northeast through the Upper Mississippi Valley and Western Ontario. Cooler, drier Canadian air will sweep across the Upper Midwest and New England, potentially leading to localized rainfall in higher terrains from upslope flow and subtropical moisture. Increased rainfall is also expected in the lower valley floors of the Four Corners region and the lee of the southern Rockies, with monsoonal-like conditions anticipated in parts of the Desert Southwest due to moisture from a mid-level tropical disturbance system, characterized by above-normal precipitable water anomalies."

There is good model agreement through day 5, but significant differences in weather patterns from Saturday into Monday are anticipated due to a developing downstream trough. The GFS model is faster and flatter, while the ECMWF predicts a slower and more amplified solution, with the Canadian model indicating an even slower and deeper system. NAEFS ensemble means are positioned between ECMWF and GFS outcomes. The forecast accounts for uncertainty in the developing trough's strength and speed, suggesting possible changes as the period progresses."

Showers and thunderstorms are forecasted primarily around Tuesday, particularly affecting the central/south-central plains to the mid-upper Mississippi Valley and extending into the Great Lakes. A trailing front will progress into the Ohio Valley but weaken in the southern Appalachians by Wednesday and Thursday. 

Rain and storm systems will return to the Pacific Northwest and northern California, advancing inland into the northern Rockies on Sunday. This is due to a developing low-pressure system from the merging of tropical and mid-latitude systems, with potential redevelopment of showers over the northwest later in the week. Heavy snow is anticipated in the Washington Cascades. Overall, the weather pattern indicates significant warming in southern regions while the northern Rockies may experience temporary cooling."
2014-10-24,61.9,0.0,44.7,18.3,"A potent extratropical low associated with tropical storm Ana will impact British Columbia and the northwestern United States from October 27 to October 31, 2014. The system is expected to generate sustained winds of 45 knots with gusts up to 55 knots, particularly in higher terrain as it approaches Vancouver Island. Heavy precipitation is anticipated due to the well-organized system, along with increased humidity resulting from moisture fed into the tropical system. Heavy snow is also likely in the northern Rockies. Following the system's passage, enhanced cold advection may lead to lake effect precipitation in the Northeast. The 06 UTC GFS model indicates a significant shift towards the WPC solution, reflecting less progression in eastern Pacific mid to upper-level troughing into the western U.S. later next week, aligning better with ECMWF ensemble models."

This will impact British Columbia and the surrounding areas, with jet-level winds influencing the weather pattern across the lower 48 states. A surface cyclone will move from the Upper Great Lakes to North Central Quebec, causing warm air advection and a surge of cooler Canadian air, leading to above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. and a notable drop in temperatures and humidity.

By the end of the week, colder air will spread across the Great Lakes and Northeast, with dew points possibly dropping below 40°F in parts of the Southeast and Gulf Coast. The West will experience warm advection stratiform precipitation, influenced by strong southeast winds. Heavy rains are expected from the U.S./Canada border down to Southwest Oregon, with rapidly fluctuating temperatures and higher wind speeds in the Northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains, which may receive minimal rainfall. Precipitation is also forecast from an Alberta Clipper in the Missouri and Ohio River Valleys, with potential for snowflakes in the Eastern Lakes and Northern Appalachians as we enter November."
2014-10-26,63.9,0.0,35.0,21.6,"Expected weather patterns indicate an amplifying upper flow late this week into the weekend, driven by remnants of tropical storm 'Ana' and additional energy from the Bering Sea. A substantial front will advance into the western U.S., with good ensemble agreement but some timing uncertainties, especially in the East. There is potential for cyclogenesis off the East Coast. 

In the West, milder conditions are expected at first with windy conditions and strong south/southeast winds; however, polar jet arrival will bring significant height falls and changes. An initial ""atmospheric river"" setup will produce modest precipitation (around 1 inch/24 hours) in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Divide. Rapid ambient temperature fluctuations are anticipated with higher wind speeds. 

The northern Rockies and adjacent high plains will experience widespread downslope conditions with limited rainfall. 

Cooler and drier Canadian air will surge into the East with the Alberta Clipper reinforcing the pattern by Thursday and Friday. This will lead to a drier airmass spreading across the Great Lakes, Northeast, and Eastern U.S. Post-frontal conditions will bring cooler temperatures, with dew points dropping along the I-20 and I-10 corridors, potentially near 40°F.

Significant temperature differences exist, with a m-18C airmass in Montana versus +6C in southeast Alaska. The intrusion of tropical moisture has shifted northward over Alaska, impacting expected trough development in the Gulf of Alaska.

Precipitation distribution will evolve as a surface wave initiates warm advection, interacting with cold, dry air and resulting in saturated low levels and maritime flow into northern California by day 7. A second Canadian high is replacing the first and is expected to increase upslope flow across the southern plains and lead to modified-arctic boundaries.

Timing uncertainties remain with Arctic air surges, particularly in the Appalachians and their potential impact on coastal temperatures. The initial surge has exited the eastern seaboard, but a secondary surge may affect mid-Atlantic and southern New England states in the coming days.

A rapid rebound in temperatures along the NM/TX border is forecasted alongside turbulent upslope flow in the Rockies.

There is some uncertainty regarding the timing of trough energy moving from the Rockies after Saturday. Enhanced precipitation is expected from the western-central Gulf Coast through the lower Mississippi Valley, primarily as rain, with possible snow on the northern edge depending on moisture and colder air. The interior West will experience the coldest temperature anomalies, while temperatures in the eastern regions trend cooler from initially above-normal readings. Significant rainfall is likely in the northwest and central Rockies. Monitoring for possible frost or freeze conditions is warranted due to low minimum temperatures in some areas."

A cold front is expected to move from the Mississippi Valley to the Appalachians, with the northern portion clearing New England by Monday. A potential surface wave may stall the front across the lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast. Strong surface ridging from Western Canada will affect the Northwest, Rockies, and North Central U.S. early next week. 

Temperatures will be below normal across much of the nation due to invading Arctic air. An elongated axis of precipitation will accompany the cold front, with heavy rains anticipated in the South and snow in the Northwestern region, though exact locations and amounts of precipitation are uncertain. Model forecasts exhibit significant variability, particularly concerning the development of a possible surface wave in the Gulf tracking toward the Southern Mid-Atlantic states."

Uncertainties exist regarding the timing of an upper low exiting the Southwest and a cold front moving into the northern tier late this week, which may impact surface low pressure evolution in the eastern U.S. Key developments in northern stream flow are anticipated around Friday, potentially altering the system's progress northeastward. Complexities are expected over Alaska around Thursday and Friday, affecting the northwestern U.S. 

The forecast includes a compact upper low moving south of Alaska and a preference for the GFS and ECMWF models based on their gradual adjustments. Low pressure is projected to track through the Great Lakes into southeastern Canada, with enhanced precipitation likely over favored terrains in Arizona and southern Utah, as well as heavier precipitation northeast from the southeastern Plains to the western-central Gulf Coast. 

Snow is expected in the vicinity of a cold front with rain confined to coastal and low elevations of the Pacific Northwest.

A forecast challenge exists for the southern Plains and Ozarks concerning precipitation types along the northern and northeastern periphery. Surface wave development is expected over the Gulf Stream, with increased spread aloft over Central Canada affecting northern stream details across the Upper Great Lakes. The heaviest rainfall potential is forecasted for the Gulf Coast states and southeastern U.S. A semi-permanent weather feature persists over the northeastern U.S. with uncertain wave and precipitation patterns. Recent GFS/GEFS runs indicate more southward suppressed QPF, while WPC products lean 60-40 towards ECMWF and its ensemble means due to recent trends and continuity."

Significant winter weather is expected in the mid-Mississippi Valley to northern Mid-Atlantic regions, with potential for rain transitioning to snow and below-average confidence in precipitation outcomes. The northern plains will experience a drop in temperatures with a cold front moving in, alongside potential snowfall in areas near the Great Lakes. Precipitation in the western U.S. will be localized and brief, while some rain is anticipated in the southern U.S. from Monday night onwards. Above normal temperatures (+10-15°F) expected in the west, variable readings in the plains, and below normal temperatures (-15 to -25°F) in the east. Winter weather potential in northwestern areas of the precipitation shield is low. Monitoring of colder air arrival from the northwest continues, with a mean pattern favoring the described temperature anomalies."
2015-01-30,36.9,0.105,46.1,25.7,"The upcoming weather pattern will feature a more amplified eastern trough and a slightly inland-drifting west coast ridge, with a broad eastern Pacific trough. Confidence in the large-scale flow is above average. A consensus of GFS and ECMWF models suggests variability in the storm system tracking from the east coast into the western Atlantic. Precipitation is expected to be heaviest in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies, with several periods of enhanced precipitation primarily from Monday to Wednesday. Wind speeds will increase with a strengthening surface gradient, particularly by late next week. 

Increased precipitation is also forecast for northern California northward, starting Thursday-Friday, as moisture from the tropics influences the region. Inland areas should trend drier as the ridge moves east. Enhanced rainfall is anticipated across the western Gulf Coast through the Southeast/East Coast, especially from Tuesday to Thursday, influenced by an upper low moving from Mexico, but specifics remain uncertain due to model variability.

Temperatures in the West will likely be above normal, with anomalies of +10 to +20°F centered near the Great Basin. The Plains will experience variable temperatures; the warmest days will be Monday-Tuesday and Friday in the northern and central areas. The East will see two cold air masses, one early in the week and another from Thursday-Friday, leading to periods of lake effect activity and light to moderate snowfall in the northern Plains. Overall, expect a mix of warmer West temperatures, variable Plains conditions, and cold temperatures in the East with possible wintry precipitation, along with temperature drops of -10 to -20°F across the East."

Precipitation is expected to increase, particularly due to surface low pressure northeast of Maine and a combination of weak eastern Pacific energy and an upper low from Mexico. Two periods of precipitation are forecasted: light to moderate amounts from Tuesday to Wednesday, and a heavier event affecting northern California, the Pacific Northwest, and northern Rockies later in the week. The central and northern Plains may experience below-normal temperatures early, while warm conditions will prevail in the western and central states, with temperature anomalies of +20-30°F by Friday-Saturday. A chilly airmass with -10 to -20°F anomalies will exit the Northeast on Tuesday, with another cool spell anticipated later in the week. Enhanced rainfall is likely along the Gulf Coast, while northern regions may see snow and lake effect activity."

Near average predictability is suggested from GFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble means. A longwave trough off the West Coast will influence weather, with significant onshore flow causing inches of precipitation in the Northwest. Widespread precipitation is expected in the East, particularly on Thursday, when a disturbance may draw moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. A cold surge is anticipated, leading to potential wintry precipitation due to low development ahead of the surge, along with uncertainty in precipitation coverage."

2015-02-04,40.3,0.0,48.9,14.4,"An east Pacific cyclone is developing, moving northeast toward southwest Canada, leading to a decay of the front moving onshore. A ridge will develop over the northern Rockies from the amplification of the cyclone, with a lee wave progressing across the northern plains by February 10th and the upper Mississippi Valley by February 11th. A positively tilted trough will move into the Great Basin on February 10th, influenced by building heights in the East Pacific ridge. The GFS model suggests lower heights at the base of the trough in the southwest, indicating a better match to current patterns than the ECMWF. 

A frontal wave is expected over the northern plains on Saturday, with multiple low-pressure centers moving into the plains and Ohio Valley by Sunday, followed by ripples of low pressure affecting the mid-Atlantic into Monday. Moderate to heavy rain is forecasted for northern California with total rainfalls of 4-6 inches and isolated higher amounts. Above-normal temperatures are expected in the west through days 3-7, while showery conditions will persist across northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Snow is expected in the eastern regions, particularly across the upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, upper Ohio Valley, and mid-Atlantic, with differences in precipitation amounts and snow predictions across models. The GFS shows higher liquid equivalents and snow amounts than the GEFS, which has less cold air advection across the east. Less weight was given to the GEFS temperature profiles due to a preference for a slightly stronger and slower-moving circulation."
2015-02-05,33.6,0.0,40.1,27.2,"Persistent moisture from the central Pacific will impact the Pacific Northwest and Southwest Canada, eroding the upper-level ridge. Milder air will spread eastward, raising temperatures across the Northern Plains, Missouri Valley, and Ohio Valley. Potential wintry precipitation may occur along the northern edge of the system in the Mid-Atlantic from Days 4-5. The Pacific moisture stream will reach deep into the Great Basin and further east, leading to warm advection and variable temperatures, especially in the central and southern Plains. A storm track is anticipated to follow the Missouri and Ohio Rivers, with a surface low potentially deepening and affecting weather in Southern New England. A surge of Arctic air may enter the Lower 48, but a Pacific ridge could limit its intrusion, enhancing instability in the Four Corners and Upper Rio Grande Valley. Overall, expect a wet West, cold and wet Northeast, and variable conditions across various regions, with weak mid-level waves complicating surface patterns."

Near to above average temperatures are expected generally, but a Canadian cold snap is anticipated to drop temperatures in the Northeast by 20F-30F, with potential record lows. Two weather systems will move eastward, bringing wintry weather to the Northeast and rain/snow to the Pacific Northwest. Precipitation is likely to focus offshore but may impact eastern New England, with increased precipitation expected in New Mexico and West Texas as the ridge develops. The Central Plains will see temperatures 10-20F above average. Wintry conditions may also occur across the north-central to eastern U.S. next Wednesday to Friday."

An active winter weather pattern will develop, bringing modest precipitation into the southwestern US from a slow-moving low near Baja. Deep cold air will follow surface lows and frontal systems, leading to an organized snow swath in the Midwest and Great Lakes and a potential coastal winter storm in the Northeast. A significant cold snap will affect the central and eastern US this weekend into early next week, with some areas nearing record low temperatures. Another large-scale winter weather threat may arise early to mid next week. High winds are likely due to tight gradients associated with low pressure systems. The western US will experience cooling and increased precipitation as ridges retrogress and amplify, while Gulf of Mexico moisture will facilitate heavy snow and icing threats from Monday to Wednesday, especially impacting the southern-central plains and Mississippi Valley. An expanding precipitation shield will affect the east-central and northeastern US."
2015-02-12,34.9,0.043,54.6,27.1,"Below normal temperatures are expected due to frigid Arctic blasts with a polar vortex impacting the central and eastern US from February 15 to February 19, 2015. Stormy winter weather is anticipated, particularly in New England, with a significant storm threat and a large wind/wave event in the western Atlantic. Deep cold air will move across the US following a coastal low, setting the stage for a winter weather threat. An amplified upstream ridge is observed, leading to cooling temperatures and an unsettling trough digging aloft.

Increased precipitation is predicted in the southwestern US and southern Rockies due to moisture returning from the Gulf of Mexico. Prolonged heavier periods of snow and dangerous icing are likely across the south-central Plains, Mississippi Valley, and parts of the eastern US as a wavering cold front approaches. The forecast indicates potential challenges with convergence and precipitation threats in the affected areas."

There is above-average predictability for large-scale flow despite uncertainties. A dangerously cold and windy system is currently impacting the northeast and will reach the Canadian Maritimes by early Monday. Focus is on shortwave energy from the western-central U.S. moving eastward by mid-week, with surface low pressure entering the western Atlantic. Models show inconsistency in these interactions, with significant spread in ensemble surface low plots. A recent trend indicates suppression from the southern plains into eastern states. The GFS, ECMWF, and CMC models support continued suppression, while the NAVGEM, DGEX, and UKMET show a northward lift. Uncertainty exists regarding shortwave energy movements over the Rockies and timing of eastern Pacific energy. A significant band of precipitation is anticipated, particularly in the southern tier states, with less coverage compared to previous forecasts. Refined precipitation types and intensities expected by Sunday, mostly rain in the south with potential for ice/snow further north.

2015-04-17,67.3,0.074,71.9,11.5,"Expect a typical April pattern with slowly moving closed features across the continental U.S. Ridging will slide northeast from the Yukon, affecting the Great Lakes and southern Ontario/Quebec. Split flow in the northeast Pacific may bring energy southward along the west coast, possibly affecting southern California. Uncertainty remains in the forecast models, particularly for the western U.S., with ECMWF and Canadian ensembles indicating a more pronounced southern dip compared to quicker GEFS members. 

Expect temperatures 5-15°F below normal due to cloud cover and atmospheric conditions. A wet pattern is anticipated on Monday and Tuesday along and east of the Mississippi River Valley, with precipitation shifting northeast into the Appalachians, New England, and the mid-Atlantic due to a stalling cutoff system in western Ontario. 

In the western U.S., isolated to scattered precipitation may occur from northern California to eastern Washington as a shallow cold front introduces maritime Pacific air, leading to convective precipitation. Temperature cooling is expected, possibly nearing record low maximums in some areas. Precipitation may extend to the Mexican border, though it will lack the intensity of mid-winter systems."
2015-04-18,71.0,0.0,55.2,7.2,"An amplified/blocky pattern is expected over the northern hemisphere, with ridging towards high latitudes and an upper low near the Great Lakes. Below average temperatures and above average precipitation are forecast across the northeast. Isolated to scattered precipitation is anticipated in the western U.S., especially from northern California to eastern Washington, due to pre-frontal and convective dynamics. Active spring weather is predicted in the Sierra and southern California from a digging trough along the west coast. Breezy to windy conditions are likely in the southern plains, but the lack of low-level Gulf moisture will limit widespread convection. Moisture will have more time to advance east of the northern and central Rockies as a cold front develops through the northeast."
2015-04-19,63.3,0.247,55.5,18.0,"Upper ridging over British Columbia will create a disjointed omega pattern across North America. A closed low will drift through southeastern Canada, bringing below average temperatures and scattered rain/snow showers to the Great Lakes and Northeast, while the Mid-Atlantic will be drier and sunnier. Max temperatures will generally be below average due to cloudiness. Precipitation will be concentrated east of the Continental Divide along the west-southwesterly jet stream and a northern stationary boundary. In the West, upper-level troughs will affect the Sierra, Central and Southern California, and the Colorado River Basin, resulting in below average temperatures and precipitation. Above average temperatures are expected in the Southern Plains and Southeast from Friday into the weekend due to a progressive southern stream shortwave."

2015-04-27,54.9,0.0,47.0,19.0,"There is uncertainty regarding the flow evolution over the eastern U.S. late this week, with a surface low developing off the southeast/mid-Atlantic coast. The ECMWF and its ensemble mean models have shifted eastward, indicating a more progressive low pressure system. Fast and flat Pacific flow is expected across the northern U.S., transitioning to a summertime pattern characterized by modest mean troughing along the southern West Coast. Model discrepancies exist regarding mid-level details, and confidence is low in conditions related to the western Atlantic low.

A stronger upper-level low is anticipated in the Ohio Valley, potentially leading to a westward surface track. The GFS model suggests an extreme upper low depth, while the ensemble means indicate a more moderate depth. Flatter and more progressive flow will bring faster, weaker fronts to the northern plains. A well-defined shortwave is expected to reach central Canada and the northern plains by next Monday, leading to a cold front extending farther east.

Forecasts for days 3-5 (Thursday to Saturday) include a blend of the GFS and ECMWF, with low confidence in GFS details over eastern-central Canada. Increased rainfall coverage is expected from the northern-central Rockies into the Great Lakes, with heaviest activity late in the period. Early cool temperatures in the east will trend warmer, with above-normal temperatures across most of the continental U.S., except for near-normal conditions in the south. Rainfall potential increases in the Appalachian and mid-Atlantic regions, with uncertainty regarding moisture reaching the northeast due to the surface low track.

2015-05-27,79.5,0.011,69.3,17.4,"Forecast for May 30 to June 3, 2015: A closed low over British Columbia weakens and moves eastwards, increasing shower activity in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies by June 2. Lower heights predicted across the Southwest U.S. indicate a favored trough from the Southwest to the West Coast. A cold front stalls in the Mid-Atlantic, bringing enhanced moisture and showers across the Great Lakes, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic, with the front returning as a warm front in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes later. A weak mid-level trough will drift east from the mid-lower Mississippi Valley into next week. The GFS and GEFS indicate variability with the trough axis located further west compared to the ECMWF/Canadian models. Enhanced moisture and increased precipitable water values are expected in Florida, raising rain chances as June, the rainiest month, approaches."
2015-05-28,79.7,0.007,67.8,14.0,"Medium-range forecast indicates high pressure building across the Great Lakes, Midwest, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic regions, leading to cooler and drier conditions. Limited precipitation is expected from a frontal boundary in the Eastern US, with a continued locally excessive rainfall threat due to moisture pooling along a slow-diminishing front. A mid-upper level cutoff low will contribute to an active weather pattern, particularly across the southern US, while moderate and terrain-enhanced precipitation is anticipated in the western/northwestern US. Wind speeds may become breezy during the transition between high pressure and the frontal boundary, but overall winds will remain mild. Average predictability is forecasted, with the potential for cyclogenesis in the northern central Rockies and plains midweek."
2015-05-29,78.2,0.0,71.2,12.4,"A prolonged period of much drier weather is expected across the southern plains starting June 1, 2015. The southeastern third of the CONUS will experience higher rainfall totals and threats of locally excessive downpours due to a weakening surface front in the Mid-Atlantic and Lower Mississippi Valley. Southern and eastern parts of Florida are likely to see enhanced rainfall influenced by an inverted surface trough and a meandering upper low over the Lower Mississippi Valley and Central Gulf Coast. Anomalously widespread organized rain and convection is anticipated from the northwestern US to the north-central Intermountain West and Rockies due to mid-upper level trough development. Enhanced inflow/lift will lead to locally heavy rainfall and monitoring of convection with severe potential. Additionally, Tropical Storm Andres is being monitored in the eastern Pacific with sustained winds of 60 knots expected to strengthen."

Uncertainties persist within the western CONUS trough, leading to lower forecast predictability due to handling issues in the eastern/southeastern states. Significant rain and thunderstorms anticipated from the north-central intermountain west/rockies through the northern half of the plains/Mississippi Valley, with locally heavy to excessive amounts possible. There is a general trend towards a more progressive nature of the upper-level low pressure system near the lower Mississippi Valley, with operational models shifting toward a more open and progressive forecast. High relative humidity and low wind shear are noted; a conservative approach is advised due to uncertainties in surface evolution. Enhanced moisture and rainfall expected in the Southeast, while potential for significant rain in the lower Mississippi Valley is diminished. More moisture anticipated in the Northeast early next week. The National Hurricane Center is monitoring early season Hurricane Andres located in the eastern Pacific near coordinates 13.7N 115.3W."

A deeper late week/weekend trough aloft is likely, with a potential embedded upper-level low. Drier conditions expected in the southern plains, while increased moisture in the southeastern quadrant is anticipated. A trough may interact with a ridge, leading to varied moisture impacts. Potential surface development suggested from moist flow extending from the western Caribbean, although a weaker surface system is likely. Heavy rainfall expected in the upper Mississippi Valley and southeastern U.S., with possible convection in the northern tier. Enhanced rainfall anticipated in the southeast and Tennessee Valley, along with locally heavy rainfall in southern Florida. Unseasonal scattered showers may occur in the western and southwestern U.S. due to the mid-upper level trough."
2015-06-01,79.3,2.018,69.7,14.9,"A reshuffle in the upper-flow pattern will bring a trough over eastern Canada and a ridge over western Canada. Weather focus will be in the southwest with an active cutoff low moving from California to the Great Basin. A shortwave ridge will influence convective initiation along the high plains and leeward Rockies. Uncertainty peaks between days 4-5 over the Missouri Valley due to northwest flow from the eastern Canada trough. The east will see challenges from a mid-level shortwave while the west will have a clearer forecast early on, but uncertainties arise around day 5. The forecast favors the 1 June/00Z model cycle, suggesting reasonable predictability into early day 6, preferring ECENS/NAEFS means for the period. An MCS-type system is expected to form over northeast Wyoming/Eastern Montana, migrating east-southeast into the Midwest, consistent with typical early June patterns. Rapid development of a new MCS in central Canada may influence forecast outcomes, with potential 'flip-flops' due to differing model speeds (GFS quicker than ECMWF). Summer-like temperatures are expected, with convective precipitation focused in the northern plains and intermountain west. Organized clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop downstream from the Rockies, while the West Coast will experience different conditions. Additionally, there will be organized rainfall in the Carolinas and Delmarva due to a Pacific front and upper-level cutoff bringing moisture inland."

Models show improved agreement for the medium range, with a significant potential for moisture surge into the Southwest, particularly on Day 4. There are varying predictions between the GFS and ECMWF regarding polar air movement. A modest increase in precipitation chances (POPs) is noted in the Southwest, allowing moisture to cross the border."
2015-06-06,73.6,0.0,70.1,18.6,"Warming and increased humidity are expected as the upper flow transitions from troughing to ridging, initiating a warm-up starting on Wednesday (day 4) and continuing through Thursday (day 5). Cooler air will move from the upper Midwest into central and northern New England after Thursday. A weak cold front will traverse the northern tier states from Tuesday to Thursday, with limited southward movement, and may produce precipitation over the central plains. Southwest flow will develop over the eastern U.S. into the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys on days 6 and 7, with decreased forecast confidence due to increased model variability. Remnants of Hurricane Blanca are anticipated to reach central Baja California by Tuesday, potentially influencing moisture patterns in the Southwest. The forecast for days 3, 4, and 5 is based on a blend of models, with heightened uncertainty for days 6 and 7 as the GFS tends to trend faster than the others."

A weak surface front will form, causing increasing humidity and warm conditions, especially in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic regions. Showers and thunderstorms are expected along a stationary front extending from the southern plains to the upper Mississippi Valley. By days 6 and 7 (Saturday and Sunday), the ECMWF indicates slight troughing in the Northeast with cooler and drier conditions in New England and the northern Mid-Atlantic. Elevated thunderstorms are likely in the Northwest as a cold front moves south and east toward Montana and the northern plains."
2015-06-08,74.9,0.583,66.6,19.3,"A broad trough will progress east into the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada on Thursday, with another trough expected over the weekend. Mid-level energy from Canada will lower heights across the northwest and northern plains, with an elongated trough in the southwest weakening while shifting northeast over an upper ridge building in the southeast. Above normal temperatures are anticipated in the interior Pacific Northwest, while the southwest to central U.S. will experience below average temperatures, and the northeast will see near to above average temperatures. There is a significant precipitation signal for the central and high plains to the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, with modest rains expected for the northwestern Gulf Coast this weekend, influenced by a surface front and an advancing moisture pool from the Gulf."
2015-06-09,79.2,0.002,59.5,14.9,"A wavy frontal boundary will persist over the central states into the northeast, affecting temperatures and precipitation. Summertime temperatures will dominate much of the continental United States outside the northern tier. Heavier precipitation with potential for local excess will mainly occur from the south-central states northeastward to the Great Lakes and across the northeast. A northern stream system in southern Canada will drag a cold front and precipitation through the northern tier. Scattered convection will linger over the moist southern and southeastern U.S. due to pooled moisture around a strengthening ridge. Models emphasize ensemble means amid increasing forecast spread, indicating reliability in larger-scale predictions but notable uncertainty in smaller-scale convection."
2015-06-10,76.9,0.006,57.8,13.1,"Heavy rainfall is possible along the north/northwest Gulf Coast, middle Mississippi Valley, and southern plains. Anomalous ridging in Alaska will lead to troughing over southwest Canada and the Pacific Northwest. Surface boundaries are expected to stall over the central plains, Great Lakes, and northern mid-Atlantic states as an upper ridge expands over the southeast/south central U.S. Models show good large scale agreement, but smaller scale differences remain, including the timing of a cold front crossing the north central U.S. on Sunday and Monday, surface lows developing on a stalled frontal boundary, and upper ridge expansion into the south central U.S. Anomalous moisture in the eastern U.S. contributes to uncertainty regarding the best areas for lift and instability. Model consensus favors the GEFS/NAEFS mean for forecasts."
2015-06-11,81.2,0.0,68.0,11.0,"Heavy rains are possible along the north/northwest Gulf Coast, southern plains, and middle to upper Mississippi Valley due to anomalous moisture being pulled northward from the Gulf. Anomalously strong ridging over southwest Alaska will influence the weather pattern across the CONUS, with frontal boundaries stalling over the central plains, Midwest, and Northeast/Northern Mid-Atlantic States. Models show good agreement on large-scale flow, but there are differences in smaller-scale details, particularly regarding the break in the subtropical ridge, affecting rainfall distribution. The ECMWF model indicates a western edge, while the GFS model suggests a more eastern break. Enhanced precipitation is expected across the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Northeast, and Northern Mid-Atlantic due to surface waves along stalled fronts.

Subtropical ridging will dominate the southern U.S., causing a stalled frontal boundary from the Central Plains to the Northern Mid-Atlantic Coast. A closing low off the British Columbia coast may lead to mean troughing over the Western U.S. by late next week. Uncertainty in the forecast increases towards Thursday and Friday, especially regarding potential breaks in the subtropical ridge over Texas and the evolution of the closed low. Increased precipitation is expected early next week from anomalous moisture being drawn north from the Gulf, leading to heavy rains in various regions including the Western Gulf Coast, Plains, Midwest, Great Lakes, Northeast, and Northern Mid-Atlantic states."

A weak system will track from the western Gulf through the South Central U.S. into the Ohio Valley early next week. Model guidance shows good agreement in the large-scale flow, but variability in solutions is anticipated due to a vortex off the British Columbia coast impacting forecasts."
2015-06-14,83.8,0.49,69.2,19.2,"Excessive rains are expected from the western Gulf Coast through the Ark-La-Tex region and into the northeast and east-central U.S. due to tropical moisture feeding inland. An expansive subtropical ridge will block northern stream frontal systems, resulting in persistent moist conditions and potential heavy rainfall in vulnerable areas. Lingering boundaries across the northeast and into the central plains may facilitate tropical development in the Gulf of Mexico, impacting weather patterns in the south-central and east-central U.S. later in the week. A deep vortex in southern British Columbia will influence conditions in the northwestern and north-central U.S. A focus on the development of an area of low pressure over the Yucatan, currently monitored by the National Hurricane Center, will impact forecasts mid to late week. Heavy rains and convection are anticipated near lingering frontal boundaries, and a cold front may lead to additional heavy rains across the mid-upper Mississippi Valley by the end of the week.

An intense August low will exit the Midwest, bringing generous precipitation ahead of the cold front which will cause cooling and lower humidity. The front weakens near the coast. The next wave of precipitation is anticipated from a shortwave system along the northern tier of states, focusing on the Upper Midwest and Central Plains. Both systems will bring cooler air, signaling a transition to fall weather."
2015-08-18,80.6,0.0,72.9,13.2,"The upper high will build over the Four Corners region, leading to warmer temperatures there. Progressive longwave troughs will move through the northern tier, causing increased precipitation in those areas. The ECMWF and ECENS models prefer more amplified solutions with potential cut-off lows. Precipitation in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic will taper off from Friday through the weekend. By Day 7 (Tuesday), rain will focus across the Central Plains and into the Western Great Lakes. Near/above climatological temperatures are expected in the West, while cooler than climatological temperatures will spread from the Northern Rockies into much of the Central and Northern U.S. Overall, temperatures will be variable, with warm conditions in the West and cooler conditions spreading eastward."

Typical summer heat will persist ahead of the front until it moves through the Northeast by around Day 6. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are likely along and ahead of the front, particularly in the Upper Midwest by Day 4."
2015-08-20,79.4,0.211,82.7,14.8,"Persistent deep-layered ridge pattern in the East Pacific and Four Corners area limits Pacific moisture migration. A migratory mid-latitude storm track is forecasted for the Northern Plains, Upper Great Lakes, and Southeast Canada. A mean trough is expected along 90W longitude across most of North America, and an upper-level ridge near 45N 155W in the Eastern Pacific. Good continuity is maintained until 25/00Z, but the ECMWF model shows uncertainty after this date, especially in Alaska and off the Washington coast. The Canadian front will lead to a dry pattern for much of the nation, with a possibility of precipitation in the Great Basin and Northern Rockies. Near to above normal temperatures are anticipated in the Four Corners region, while slightly cooler conditions and above-average rainfall are expected from the Olympics to the Alaska Panhandle."

A Canadian surface high will impact areas east of the Mississippi, with development in the north-central plains by day 6. An amplification of the upper-level ridge is expected in the southwest/southern Rockies, likely leading to diminished precipitation probabilities due to 'watering down' effects from maritime influences. Insufficient mid-level moisture may migrate north along California's corridor.

Quasi-stationary closed mid-level systems are creating a blocky pattern with limited impacts on the overall forecast. The northward migration of a thermal trough is expected into northern California and western Oregon, along with uncertainty regarding an upper-level cyclone over the Four Corners and its interaction with monsoonal moisture. The introduction of 'Atsani' may impact the west coast, contributing to varied weather solutions. 

Increased precipitation challenges are anticipated in the southeast, with the progressive mid-latitude flow leading to enhanced rainfall, particularly along the southeast coast. Locally moderate precipitation is expected in the northern and western periphery of the anticyclone, with potential for increased coverage across the northern plains and Great Lakes as the next Canadian frontrunner approaches.

Significant tropical systems 'Atsani' and 'Goni' are influencing weather patterns, with potential effects on the western North American coast through day 4 and beyond using a 70% ECENS and 30% GEFS model blend. Weather transitions are leading to a notable shift in patterns, particularly following typhoon activities. The Bering Strait's high-latitude flow interacting with tropical moisture suggests a stronger and deeper atmospheric pattern along the west coast. In the Atlantic, tropical energy is moving westward, influenced by a weak subtropical ridge and a progressive front across southeast Canada, stable through day 6. The predicted system in the mid-Mississippi Valley could alter conditions in the southeast US, particularly concerning interactions with the upper-level trough and subtropical ridge from days 6 to 7."

Expect a blend of ECENS and NAEFS models for broad flow patterns, with GFS and ECMWF models detailing smaller features. Uncertainty exists for weather along the West Coast, especially in Central/Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. A northern stream will influence a Pacific-influenced system across the Northern High Plains, affecting the I-80 corridor (San Francisco to Salt Lake City). Limited model support is noted for scenarios in the Central Rockies and Central Plains, with a preference for larger scale models. Dominant weather patterns include a closed low near the Texas Gulf Coast and scattered convection in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Confidence in following GFS/ECMWF models persists until 00Z October 2. A lingering mid-level boundary remains along the East Coast and Western Atlantic beyond day 5, with a strong surface ridge over New England."

A blocky pattern will persist from the central Pacific through North America into the Atlantic. Troughing is expected to impact OR/ID and the Plains, while ridging builds over Hudson Bay. Variability in surface boundary evolution off the East Coast may lead to uncertainties in precipitation locations. ECMWF and Canadian models predict troughing in the Great Basin, while GEFS models suggest ridging. A cool and wet pattern is anticipated in the East due to upper troughing and influences from tropical depression eleven. Terrain-enhanced precipitation is expected in the north-central Intermountain West/Rockies, with localized convective downpours across the Central U.S. Surface high pressure will persist in SE Canada. The upstream central Pacific closed low is expected to remain near 150W."
2015-09-29,75.0,1.668,87.7,14.5,"The extended forecast from October 2 to October 6, 2015, shows considerable uncertainty due to model and ensemble spread. A blocky pattern with multiple closed features is expected over northern America and the eastern Pacific/western Atlantic, transitioning to a more progressive regime. Key focus includes Tropical Storm Joaquin off the east coast.

Heavy rainfall potential is likely along and somewhat inland from the central to northern east coast, influenced by a slower-moving western Atlantic low pressure system. Forecast models indicate a vigorous closed low pressure system affecting the west coast, tracking southward and impacting the Great Basin. Precipitation is anticipated over the Rockies and Plains, guided by a combination of atmospheric features.

Temperatures are predicted to be significantly below normal, particularly in the northern-central plains and eastern states, with highs 10-15°F below average from Friday to Sunday. Increased precipitation potential is noted in the Intermountain West compared to drier GFS runs, but less extensive than the operational ECMWF. Overall, expect cooler temperatures and elevated precipitation chances in specific regions."

A transition towards a lower amplitude and progressive weather regime is expected. The forecast is based on ECMWF and GEFS models, indicating an upper low moving into the northwest by Saturday. The western U.S. upper low is expected to track southward, influencing weather patterns and leading to a flattening of the large-scale pattern progressing into the plains.

The eastern U.S. forecast remains uncertain due to varying predictions for Hurricane Joaquin and an upper trough in eastern Canada, affecting regions from New England to the Canadian Maritimes. Areas along the east coast should monitor forecasts, as potential exists for strong winds and heavy rainfall. 

Expect areas of precipitation in the western-central states with strong winds combined with heavy rainfall due to an upper-level low moving into the plains. High temperatures are projected to have the greatest below normal anomalies in central-eastern areas over the weekend, while most of the lower 48 should see highs within 10°F of normal by the middle of next week. Isolated model runs indicate possible enhanced rainfall, and generally unsettled weather should lead to warmer minimum temperatures, with near to above normal minimums across much of the country by late in the period."

The initial model outputs show GFS running slightly fast and ECMWF slower, with an intermediate solution providing the best consistency. Confidence decreases in how the system manifests after Friday due to subtle upper-level details that affect surface system timing. The western North America ridge appears stronger with less divergence in forecasts, with a flatter ridge possible but current trends favoring the established ridge configuration. An upper low over Arizona is projected to move into the upper Rio Grande Valley. Ensemble consensus indicates influences from the upper low and/or energy moving around the eastern western North America ridge may retrogress across northern Mexico. Heavy rainfall is expected over southwestern Texas, with lesser amounts in the northern areas where localized enhancement is possible. A surface low and frontal system will generate rain moving east from the northern plains, influenced by moist flow from the western Gulf of Mexico. Expect highs and lows to be 10-20°F above normal in the northern plains, with extreme temperatures extending from the west into the northern plains. Monitoring of moisture/energy from Tropical Storm Oho is necessary as it may impact patterns ahead of the eastern-central Pacific trough, with current guidance showing considerable spread."

Guidance indicates a developing upper trough, with consensus from GFS, ECMWF, and UKMET models. A surface low will deepen as it moves northeast into the upper Great Lakes. There are indications of a weaker wave near New England by Friday, but confidence in details decreases towards the period's end due to variability among models.

Precipitation will increase from the plains eastward, with the highest amounts expected from the central/north-central plains into the upper Great Lakes. Early in the period, portions of the interior West will experience rain and snow, with mainly modest snowfall confined to the northwestern edge of the precipitation shield. Strong winds and potential severe weather are forecast from the central-southern plains to the western Ohio and Tennessee valleys from Wednesday into early Thursday.

Temperatures will vary significantly: below to well below normal in the West, especially on Tuesday and Wednesday, while warm temperatures will advance from the plains into the East, with anomalies of 10-20°F possible, particularly with minimum temperatures exceeding 20°F above normal in the warm sector from Wednesday to Thursday. Expect a wet pattern over the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies, and rainfall along the East Coast early in the forecast period. By late in the forecast, moderate temperatures will trend above normal across the northern tier and near to slightly below normal in the south. Overall, expect contrasting weather patterns of cool in the West and warm in the East."

Temperatures in the West will initially be 5-15°F below normal on Wednesday, returning to near normal by next weekend. Rain and high elevation snow are expected primarily in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, with potential for moderate to heavy precipitation. Active weather will dominate as the strong system tracks northeast from the central plains, with the highest precipitation totals expected in the north-central plains and upper great lakes, as well as potential maxima over New England with a late week wave. There may be significant winds and possible severe weather threats in the eastern half of the central-southern plains to just west of the Appalachians between Wednesday and early Thursday, with low probabilities of substantial snowfall. The eastern half of the CONUS will see a transition from well above normal to modestly below normal temperatures. By next weekend, above normal temperatures are expected to return to the northern-central plains and the Mississippi Valley."

Upper ridging over the eastern CONUS and western Atlantic will influence weather patterns, supporting successive troughing in the western and central states. Models show good agreement through next Tuesday, with energy digging through the interior west and Four Corners region. A closed low is expected to develop near New Mexico late Monday into Tuesday. Low confidence persists in deterministic solutions due to ensemble differences regarding height forecasts over California and Nevada. 

A frontal boundary will progress through the western region next Sunday and Monday, bringing widespread showers and mountain snow to affected areas; Southern California and the Desert Southwest are expected to remain dry. A new surface low in the southern plains may bring snow on its Northwest side and create a severe weather threat due to enhanced moisture from the Gulf and a strong upper jet at about 130 knots. Heavy rain is anticipated, with several inches expected particularly from eastern Texas and Louisiana northward to the Ohio Valley. An increased threat of severe weather exists on Monday in eastern Texas."

The longwave pattern will feature an exiting trough in the east, replaced by building heights and ridging into eastern Alaska, while troughing occurs through the western states. Initial models show good agreement through Tuesday, but differences post-Tuesday may alter surface conditions. An upper low may form in the Pacific Northwest, with two scenarios: either maintaining coherence or allowing energy to move into the high plains. Expect a chilly period in the east, marking the coldest air of the season for many. Significant weather anticipated for central and eastern Montana into the Dakotas during the busy travel days. Record cold maximum temperatures predicted for Oregon and California. Precipitation likely to remain offshore for the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with falling snow levels behind the Pacific and Arctic fronts.

A strong upper low will bring snow and windy conditions to the central/northern Rockies, leading to difficulties in travel due to blowing snow and wind chill temperatures dropping below zero in parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Increased precipitation is anticipated as the cold front interacts with Gulf moisture, leading to more warm sector rainfall by the latter half of the week. The initial troughing pattern will shift to more cold and showery conditions as an arctic front follows around Wednesday-Thursday. Snow accumulation is expected in the High Plains as the front sinks southward. Windy and showery/snowy conditions are likely throughout the region."
2015-11-21,46.5,0.0,59.4,11.0,"Heavy snow and rainfall are expected for travelers during the Thanksgiving holiday, with much below normal temperatures across the western-central states. A cold surge will bring temperature anomalies of -10 to -25°F for highs, especially over the eastern slopes of the northern-central Rockies, resulting in areas of snow. Strong winds may produce low wind chill values and blowing snow in some areas. Increasingly heavy rainfall and convection are anticipated over parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley later in the week, aided by moisture from Gulf inflow. The eastern region should experience warmer temperatures after a cool start on Tuesday, with light rainfall possible along the eastern coast of Florida due to onshore flow, while most of the East remains dry due to a strong ridge. Significant snow accumulation is possible, but uncertainty exists regarding wintry precipitation amounts."

In contrast, colder and unstable conditions will prevail in the intermountain west, influenced by a slow-moving upper-level low off California, which will bring a broad, cold cyclonic flow. A strong Canadian high will push southward, leading to a wet system as shortwave energy moves from the southern Rockies across the central plains into the Midwest and central Great Lakes, supported by decent low-level Gulf of Mexico moisture. The deterministic GFS and ECMWF models provide a reasonable outlook through Saturday, with divergence expected as the downstream ridge breaks down across the southeast. The forecast is based on ECMWF and NAEFS means for 60-70% of the content, with emphasis on the ECMWF model for details concerning the path of the Canadian high across the eastern third of the nation during days 6-7."

A system will exit New England while another approaches the west coast, with potentially faster timing for the northeastern system. Variability in model solutions exists for the energy crossing Eastern North America early to mid-period. Influences from southeast energy may create waviness along a front over Florida. A closed circulation is expected near the Four Corners region around Saturday, continuing into the Plains. Heaviest precipitation will be over the central-northern west coast, while the Rockies may experience modest snowfall and scattered rain in the Plains due to limited Gulf inflow.

There is uncertainty regarding a mid-level system affecting the Four Corners and South-Central High Plains, with differing model predictions: ECMWF and GFS suggesting a closed low, while Canadian and UKMET models show an open wave. A weak surface reflection exists within strong Canadian high pressure. 

Temperatures will remain mild in the northern states and near average in the southern states. Central and Southern Florida is expected to be considerably wetter, with large precipitation totals anticipated due to jet-driven and low-level warm advection.

A sub-960mb cyclone in the Gulf of Alaska will impact weather patterns, with some models indicating pressure values possibly as deep as 938mb. Forecasting consistency is vital, particularly for the days 6-7 period, and will involve a mix of ECENS and NAEFS means. The ECMWF and UKMET models are reliable, projecting three migrating systems: an initial shortwave exiting the Northeast, a lead Pacific shortwave and cold front on Tuesday, and a third system impacting the West Coast later in the week. Mild conditions are forecasted with temperatures about 10°F above normal in the Divide and Plains, alongside windy conditions and dry weather from a modified Pacific airmass impacting the Missouri Valley and Ozarks.

Rainfall intensity will vary due to differences in model forecasts, particularly among GFS and ECMWF systems regarding low pressure placement. Confidence is moderate due to varying predictions for the second trough, with GFS trending weaker and ECMWF stronger. Expect heaviest precipitation in the northern Sierra Nevada and northern California coast during the first half of the period, with lighter rain and snow across the rest of the West. A broad area of active weather, supported by strong dynamics and gulf inflow, will affect the eastern states, leading to potential severe weather and wintry precipitation in certain regions. Unseasonably warm air with temperatures 20-30°F above normal may lead to record highs in the eastern states. Enhanced rainfall is likely in the warm sector, but with less intensity than the first system; snow is possible in the northern tier.

The system is projected to drift northeast by days 5-6, with moisture extending into the Midwest and Ohio Valley, while a transition from warm to cooler temperatures is anticipated in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic from Thursday to Saturday. 

Challenges in temperature and precipitation distributions arise due to a quasi-stationary upper-level ridge, particularly impacting Florida, Georgia, and the Tennessee Valley. Enhanced precipitation is also expected in the central Great Lakes, Midwest, and Ohio Valley due to a moisture plume and perturbations from the southern plains cutoff. 

Convective outflow and a rain-cooled airmass boundary may lead to significant rainfall along the I-10/I-20 corridors from Eastern Texas to the Alabama/Florida state line. Forecasters anticipate at least 5-10 inches of liquid totals, especially in Northern California and Southwestern Oregon, with lighter amounts spreading through the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies.

The West Coast is expected to experience consistently below normal temperatures, primarily during the daytime. In contrast, areas east of the Rockies will see maximum temperatures 10-20°F above normal and minimums 15-25°F above normal, with isolated record high temperatures possible.

A warming trend is expected in the Northwest by mid to late week, with temperature anomalies of +10-20°F, particularly in the eastern U.S. where minimum temperatures may exceed 20°F above normal. A warm sector will form ahead of the system, lifting temperatures across the region."
2016-03-26,50.5,0.0,52.9,16.5,"A strong ridge will bring above-normal heights to the Alaska Panhandle and western Canada, weakening slightly later in the period. A deep trough will dig southward through Canada into the northern United States and upper Great Lakes, creating significant weather uncertainty, particularly with a storm system affecting the Plains and Great Lakes. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the strength, track, and timing of the surface low associated with this system. 

Significant organized snow and rain are expected in the Great Basin, northern Rockies, and high plains due to the upper low and surface system emerging from the west. Heavy rainfall is likely from the lower Mississippi Valley into the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic, with less intense rain expected for the rest of the East. 

Daytime temperatures will be 10-20°F below normal in the Great Basin, Southwest, and northern-central Rockies and high plains early in the period. Upslope enhanced precipitation is anticipated in the northern-central Rockies primarily Wednesday night-Thursday, with possible light precipitation and lake effect snow in the upper Great Lakes from a stronger front. Minimum temperatures are forecasted to be 10-25°F above average in the East around Thursday-Friday, followed by a significant decline with northern tier temperatures expected to be 10-20°F below average for highs next Saturday."

Above to well above normal temperatures forecast, with record highs possible; high temperatures expected to be at least 15-20°F below normal by late next weekend in the Great Lakes region. Precipitation potential in the northern-central Rockies and Upper Mississippi Valley, with possible snow but limited accumulation due to marginal temperatures. Brisk winds with potential for strong to severe convection. Warming trend expected from Wednesday to Friday, continuing into the weekend; modest increase of moisture in northern half of the West next weekend with possible precipitation in the Southern Rockies/Rio Grande Valley."
2016-03-28,56.0,0.329,67.5,28.5,"Models indicate below normal forecast spread and uncertainty from March 31 to April 4, 2016. Days 3-5 show reasonable predictability with average temperatures. A significant mid-upper level trough and deepened surface low will impact the eastern-central US and eastern NOAA on Thursday and Friday, bringing widespread moisture and enhanced precipitation threats, including modest snow potential in the north. Moisture will linger over the southwestern US and northern Mexico through Thursday and Friday, with impulse energy moving across the southern and southeastern US from Saturday to Monday. Cooling surges from Canada are expected, leading to modest snow in the northern tier. Heaviest rain potential will focus over Florida, with deeper moisture pooling and convergence. The models suggest a more developed surface low in the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, contrasting with guidance indicating high pressure suppressing low development. Modest moisture and precipitation are expected to return to the northwest due to an approaching mid-upper level trough."

Good model consensus for Friday-Saturday in the north and east with an exiting system off the east coast and an incoming Canadian clipper. GFS model lags in the southwestern and south-central CONUS regarding a once-closed low that has opened. ECMWF model is quicker and weaker, suggesting a more organized surface wave along the Gulf front. A stationary boundary will separate chilly air in the north from milder air in the south, influencing surface wave development in the Ohio Valley. Milder temperatures expected in the northwest, with a return to the 90s in the desert southwest during afternoons. Increased precipitation chances in the northwest on Monday and Tuesday with milder conditions. Below normal temperatures and lake effect snow expected in the Great Lakes and northeast late Sunday into Monday. Precipitation well above average in Florida from Saturday to Monday due to an upper trough/frontal wave."

First system affecting the Great Lakes and Northeast this weekend; second system moving from the High Plains to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast from Sunday to Tuesday; third system impacting the West from Monday to Wednesday; and a frontal boundary with possible surface wave through Florida on Sunday and Monday. 

Model consensus indicates significant differences in the exit of a surface low over New England on Sunday. GFS and ensemble means suggest a northern path, while ECMWF/UKMET/CANADIAN models indicate a southern route. Divergence exists in handling the breakdown of the ridge in the West. GFS indicates a deep trough or upper low near California late Monday into Tuesday, while skepticism exists about its prediction of a closed low in Southern California.

Milder temperatures are expected in the Northwest as ridging is replaced by an upper trough, with rising precipitation chances on Monday and Tuesday. The Desert Southwest will see 90s, about 10-15°F above average, but below record highs. In the Great Lakes and Northeast, expect below normal temperatures and increasing lake effect precipitation, primarily as snow. Northern Mid-Atlantic will experience cooler temperatures with potential snow and cold rain. Heavy rain is possible in Florida from Saturday into Monday, with another system bringing light mix of rain and snow to the Northern Plains next week."

A low-pressure system will track from the High Plains through the Great Lakes into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, with intensification near New England. 

Temperatures in the East will fall well below average, with single digits and teens recorded, especially on Wednesday. Snow cover will contribute to the colder temperatures. Significant precipitation, including several inches of snow, is anticipated in New England, aided by moisture from the Atlantic. 

In the Southwest, light precipitation is expected late Thursday through Saturday as a closed low moves towards Southern California. A cold front may stall in Northeastern Mexico, influencing weather across Northern California/Nevada and into Colorado/New Mexico and Western/Central Texas. Potential for freezes and frosts exists in southern areas where the growing season has begun, indicating a drastic drop in temperatures for early April."
2016-04-03,45.1,0.19,38.7,37.1,"Record high temperatures are expected in the west while the northeast will experience record low temperatures. An impressive weather system is developing in the east, leading to significant precipitation, particularly in New England and Maine from Friday to Saturday due to moisture influx from the subtropics and western Atlantic. The northern regions of New York and Canada may see substantial snowfall on the cold side of the front. A robust northern stream system is anticipated to move from the upper Midwest into the eastern U.S. by Friday, with varying model predictions for its track, favoring the non-GFS solutions. In the west, a lead closed low will enter northwest Mexico and southern California early Thursday, with subsequent systems increasing precipitation across the southwestern U.S. as the offshore flow subsides. Upper ridging will retrograde towards the Alaska Panhandle, allowing for troughing to advance into the northern Rockies and high plains by next weekend."
2016-04-04,57.3,0.073,51.9,23.6,"A complex deepening trough will impact the eastern United States from Thursday to Monday, bringing fluctuating temperatures. Cooler temperatures are expected in the northwestern region due to an upper low and a shortwave from western Canada. Rainfall will accompany an east coast system on Thursday, with thunderstorms possible, and wet snow may occur on the western fringes. An active early April pattern will create cold temperatures in the Midwest and East from Friday to Saturday, with potential modifications by Sunday. Rain and snow showers are expected throughout the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, as well as the Appalachians. A surge of colder air on Monday may lead to upslope snowfall in the Rockies. Increased chances for showers across the Southwest, Great Basin, and Rockies are anticipated on Sunday into Monday, with potential severe weather in the southern Plains and central Mississippi Valley.

Temperature drop expected due to a blocked flow over Greenland, bringing cooling and a potential heavy snow threat in Eastern North America. A series of mid-upper level troughs will progress from the N-central US to the NE US, supporting additional precipitation and a cold air surge. Southern California and surrounding areas will experience widespread precipitation, including heavy mountain snows. An increasing threat for heavy convective rains is likely across the E-central to E-NE US as Gulf moisture feeds into a wavering frontal zone. A significant weather system may impact the US West Coast late next week, potentially transitioning to cooler and wetter conditions."
2016-04-08,47.8,0.0,44.5,18.4,"Chilly air is expected as a cold front advances, bringing rain and showers across the frontal boundary. High pressure is retreating off the east coast, leading to cooler temperatures and precipitation in the upper Mississippi Valley and upper Midwest. The eastern trough will lift northeast, resulting in a cool high-pressure area and decreased precipitation. Significant model differences are anticipated over the northern and eastern Pacific, potentially influencing forecasts beyond day 5. The potential for surface waves to develop along the Gulf/Southeast coast exists. Confidence in high pressure dominance through day 7 is high, though differences in the speed of trough systems moving eastward are noted, especially between ECMWF and GEFS forecasts.

2016-04-30,53.9,0.022,81.7,8.8,"An upper low will close off near the west coast around Thursday, leading to slow evolution of an upper trough and the development of a low within it. Confidence in specific forecasts is low due to model divergence. Increased energy is expected over the Plains and Mississippi Valley on Tuesday. A broad area of precipitation, mostly rain, will develop from the west coast into the Rockies and potentially reach the Plains by next weekend, with the highest totals expected over favored terrain. Northern areas will experience temperatures 5-15°F above normal, while central and southern regions will trend cooler, with highs over 10°F below normal by Saturday. The eastern U.S. will see a cool and unsettled pattern, particularly from the Eastern Great Lakes to the East Coast, with significant rainfall potential and varying impacts from systems affecting wind and rainfall amounts."
2016-05-01,54.9,0.467,91.5,10.0,"The forecast indicates a blocky weather pattern with a closed upper low near the California coast moving eastward and another closed low embedded within a deep eastern trough. The models show stability in the upper low's progression into the west, becoming slower by next weekend. Significant uncertainty exists for the eastern U.S. and western Atlantic, especially regarding the evolution of Great Lakes energy. A compact wave is expected to develop by day 5, followed by a second western Atlantic surface system associated with the upper low. 

Expect widespread rain and high-elevation snow from the western U.S. to the Rockies, with rainfall beginning over the plains by next weekend. Northern areas of the western U.S. are likely to experience warmer temperatures, while the northern Rockies and high plains may cool significantly from Friday to Sunday. Central and southern regions will face a pronounced cooling trend with below-normal high temperatures.

Higher precipitation totals are anticipated from favored terrain inland from the central west coast to the central and north-central Rockies/high plains. Cool and unsettled weather is expected for the eastern states due to deep upper troughing and surface lows, with the highest probability for enhanced rainfall in the central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic region into the northeast. Organized rainfall is also expected in Florida from a cold frontal passage early in the period, with attention on low-level wind strength and direction."

A warming trend will occur from the Rockies to the central and eastern US from Thursday to Monday. Unsettled weather with significant precipitation is anticipated over the Mid-Atlantic states from Thursday to Saturday due to multiple surface lows, with upper troughing supporting cool conditions in the eastern US."
2016-05-03,64.6,0.113,84.5,12.4,"Closed low season persists over the CONUS, transitioning to less blocky flow next week. Models indicate an east-northeast movement of a significant weather system from Southern California to the Upper Midwest over five days. The ECMWF and Canadian models are faster than the GFS, forecasting a trough across British Columbia on Sunday. An upper low will exit into the Atlantic, leading to Canadian troughing and potentially another occluded system in Quebec/Northern New England next Sunday/Monday. A broad area of rain is anticipated, with highest totals in the Sierra Nevada and Intermountain West, extending into parts of Colorado, Wyoming, and the plains. A deep trough will bring rain and high elevation snow to the West with severe storms possible on Saturday in West Texas, Western Kansas, and Eastern Colorado.

A low-pressure wave may develop over the Great Lakes by next Thursday, but uncertainty remains high. The initial upper low will move toward the Plains and Mississippi Valley through mid-next week, with a significant low-pressure system impacting the Midwest and Great Lakes. Below normal temperatures are expected, with departures of 5 to 10 degrees from climatology, alongside abundant showers. Severe weather is possible in the southern and central Plains due to convective activity; significant rainfall is anticipated. A front will bring precipitation from the central Plains to the Ohio Valley, with increased precipitation threats in early to mid-next week.

The continental United States will experience a mostly progressive pattern with subtropical ridging moving westward from the Bahamas and South Florida. Models are in better agreement for the period from Tuesday to Thursday, though there is increasing spread regarding a closed low off the west coast and the eastward motion of a cold front. Overall model spread is below average. Temperatures are expected to remain slightly below average, particularly along the east coast. Precipitation will move eastward as dual frontal systems pass through on Tuesday, with additional rain expected Wednesday and Thursday, especially in the central mid-Atlantic region. The cold front will gradually push offshore late Friday into Saturday, bringing another round of showers. Meanwhile, ridging will build in the Intermountain West, leading to above-average temperatures west of the divide after Tuesday."

A lead closed low is expected to travel from the high plains to the Great Lakes and southeastern Canada, while another closed low approaches the west coast from the eastern Pacific. A consensus blend of models shows cooler temperatures expected in the east by the weekend, while much of the west and southern tier will experience above-average temperatures. Limited heavy precipitation is forecast due to a lack of blocked flow. There is a risk of severe weather in Missouri on Wednesday. Widespread precipitation will extend eastward on Thursday and Friday, with additional chances for the mid-Atlantic and Northeast over the weekend from a secondary cold front. Light rain and high elevation snow are expected in the central/northern Rockies and Great Basin, with a possible precipitation focus in the southern plains near Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas next weekend."

By Day 7 (Tuesday), moisture from the Gulf will contribute to wetter conditions. The front will also stall in the northern and central Rockies as a weakening Pacific upper trough arrives on the West Coast during the weekend. There may be additional upper-level energy and cool air in the northern plains early next week, though with low predictability. 

Expect cooler and wetter conditions in the Pacific Northwest and northern divide, with organized precipitation primarily between the I-80 and I-40 corridors. Cooler than normal temperatures are anticipated for the northern plains, Great Lakes, and New England. Precipitation is expected to spread east from the plains into the southern and southeastern states early next week, influenced by a series of Canadian airmass intrusions."

2016-05-15,54.7,0.005,42.5,24.1,"Northern stream shortwave energy will cross the northeastern U.S. Wednesday to Thursday, with lower continuity in forecasts. A trend of similarities in shortwave forecasts moving from the Rockies into the plains is expected to amplify towards the east coast. Heavy rainfall is likely in the southern-central to eastern U.S., with significant rainfall in the northern Rockies possible due to dynamics from the ejecting shortwave. A surface front will stall near the Gulf Coast, impacting precipitation, and severe weather potential will be monitored. Much below normal daytime temperatures are anticipated in the southern plains and eastern slopes of the Rockies on Wednesday and Thursday, with anomalies of -15 to -25°F for highs. The northern plains will see above normal temperatures, while the central-southern plains trend above normal by the weekend. Snow is likely in the northern Rockies. The western U.S. will transition from well above normal to well below normal temperatures as the upper trough settles, while the eastern U.S. will see warmer trends west of the Appalachians and near to below normal temperatures along the southern east coast."

Strong Canadian high pressure precedes it, with potential development of a trackable low moving towards the east coast by day 6. The migratory trough is forming correctly, and the ECMWF model suggests a balance in surface differences due to the shortwave. The downstream ridge is expected to amplify along the Mississippi River, slowing the Pacific front over the plains. Cooler temperatures are anticipated in the Pacific Northwest and northern continental divide. A wetter than normal pattern is forecast for the Southeast/Gulf Coast and additional rain is expected in the Mid-Atlantic next weekend."
2016-05-17,55.8,0.409,78.1,9.6,"Cool and wet weather will dominate the CONUS due to a rex-block pattern, with closed lows affecting the west and east coasts. Confidence is high early in the period due to a large closed low along the west coast; however, confidence decreases from the Mississippi Valley eastward due to interaction with the northern stream and convective uncertainties. Rainfall chances are increasing in New England, but there remains uncertainty about its extent. The ECMWF model indicates a faster northward movement of the eastern closed low, while the GFS model is slower and projects a more southern track. Overall, cooler conditions will prevail, with wetter, showery weather in the western regions and heavier precipitation extending from the Appalachians eastward."

An upper low near the East Coast will drift northeast towards the Canadian Maritimes, with stable weather patterns but increasing uncertainties later in the period. Initial western trough energy will move across the northern plains into southern Canada. Expect multiple episodes of convection over the plains and into the Mississippi Valley, with potential for heavy rainfall. High temperatures in the West will be below normal, but anomalies may diminish over time. Scattered rainfall is anticipated in the northern two-thirds of the West due to lingering upper troughing. Areas of precipitation will occur off the East Coast with a gradual drying trend as the upper low moves northeast.

The eastern U.S. will experience multiple days of warm and humid conditions, with high temperatures showing anomalies of plus 5-12°F. Heavy and severe convection is anticipated over the central-southern plains, with some precipitation extending into the Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes/Northeast. Uncertain positioning of a mean frontal boundary may lead to cooler temperatures in the Northeast and increased chances for rain and convection in Florida and the southeastern coast by the latter half of the period. A trough in the west and ridging in the east will create divergent weather patterns across regions. An upper low is expected to move into the northwestern states by the weekend, with models showing varying predictions for its track. High moisture levels and low wind shear could support potential tropical/subtropical development near Florida."

Below average daytime maximum temperatures are expected in the west due to troughing, alongside widespread light rain. A daily threat of rain and storms is present in the plains, but placement remains uncertain. Humidity levels may decrease with the shift to summer weather, and calmer wind conditions are anticipated in the eastern U.S. due to the northward shift of the jet stream. The southeast could become unsettled as an inverted trough or weak surface low approaches, resulting in increased cloud cover and potentially decreasing afternoon maximum temperatures.

A sluggish flow is expected across the northeast, resulting in diurnally-active convective clusters in the plains and westward-moving shortwaves affecting the southeast coast. A slightly cooler airmass is forecast to move southeast from southern Canada into the Midwest due to a cyclone. There are two cutoff lows along 30N impacting the lower 48 states, significantly affecting weather patterns and movement. The southeast coast will see a diffuse, oscillating disturbance with tropical characteristics that may affect convective activity, and may not be easily represented on daily charts. Broad cyclonic mid-level flow is anticipated near 30-31N 77W-78W, with additional updates provided by NHC as the situation evolves offshore."

The deterministic ECMWF model is preferred for its realistic trajectory of a tropical disturbance (Invest AL912016) in the Ohio Valley and Northeast, supported by the ECENS/ECMWF combination. A humid and unstable airmass will migrate northwestward, creating a contrast with a Canadian airmass, leading to a hit-or-miss shower pattern primarily affected by shortwave energy and a sea breeze front. Precipitation challenges exist from the first coast of Florida to the Piedmont. A moderate surface cyclone is expected to develop east of the Montana/Alberta divide, leading to summer-like convective precipitation patterns across the Mississippi/Ohio River confluence, with a Canadian cold front pushing south into the Mid Mississippi Valley and Central Great Lakes."

Divergence in mid-level energy migration and trough evolution is expected between day 4 and day 6. A 70/30 distribution of ECENS to GEFS mean forecasts is anticipated by day 6. Two new closed mid-level lows are projected to form, one near the western Gulf Coast/Northeast Mexico and another west of Southern California. The flow pattern along the US/Canada border is changing, influenced by a vertically-stacked anticyclone, which is likely to result in warmer temperatures across the Great Basin. The closed 500 mb low is expected to move northward due to the anticyclone. Upper-level low associated with 'TD 02/Bonnie' is also predicted to move northward."

A cold front will move from the eastern Midwest to the east coast on Saturday, and an upper trough will progress eastward across Texas. A ridge in the southwest will strengthen as shortwaves move southward, with weather patterns transitioning from the northern plains southeast toward the Ohio Valley. Ensemble models show uniformity, but there are significant differences among individual simulations; ECMWF and Canadian models reflect low amplitude solutions, while GFS and GEFS models suggest a more amplified pattern. Significant additional rainfall is likely across eastern Texas due to frontal interaction, and showers are expected ahead of the front and near Bonnie's remnant low, with a chance for heavy rainfall there. The next intrusion of cooler air will bring uncertainty, with a high likelihood of a pattern shift and reduced predictability for frontal features.

Significant precipitation is expected across the Midwest, southern plains, Gulf Coast, and Southeast on Saturday due to an upper low in Texas. Rainfall is likely in the Middle Atlantic and New England with increased thunderstorm chances in the Upper Mississippi Valley and Midwest. Diurnal convection will lead to storms in the Southeast and Gulf Coast. As the second cold front moves in early next week, cooler temperatures will arrive in the northern US, especially the Midwest and Northeast, increasing the risk of showers and thunderstorms.

A weak upper low in the western ridge will enhance convection, while a cold front has already cleared the East Coast, leading to relatively cooler temperatures. Scattered showers and possible thundershowers are anticipated due to embedded impulses in the eastern trough, with potential heavy downpours from a tropical low in the Eastern Gulf moving toward western Florida. By midweek, high pressure will build across the eastern US, but showers may persist in the Mid-Atlantic and New England due to lingering upper troughs.

General troughing is present in the northeastern and northwestern U.S., with models showing different approaches to the western and eastern troughs. The GFS model suggests amplified troughs and carries shortwave energy into the northern Rockies and high plains next weekend, while the ECMWF indicates less amplification. Low-pressure development across southern Canada is uncertain, with differing outcomes from GFS and ECMWF regarding location. Only nominal weakness in the ridge is expected in Ontario, Quebec, and the Great Lakes, with minimal southward movement of heights into the upper Great Lakes and northern New England over the next 6 to 7 days. Weak frontal boundaries may cause shower activity in the plains, Great Lakes, and western Appalachian slopes. Models show difficulties in continuity across Arctic Canada. Mid-level southwest flow along the Pacific coast and tropical easterlies over the southern Gulf of Mexico may complicate precipitation generation."

Persistent terrain-focused precipitation will occur in the northern two-thirds of the West, with potential heavy precipitation episodes most likely in northern California and/or western Oregon. Near to slightly above normal temperatures are expected on Friday, trending near or below normal through the weekend and early next week. Lake effect snow will taper after Friday, with moisture spreading across the northern tier and eastern half of the country, leading to locally enhanced precipitation. Wintry weather is anticipated in the northern third of the central-eastern states with heightened activity possible later due to a developing deeper low pressure system. Overall, there is significant uncertainty regarding precipitation location and timing, along with low confidence in specific solutions."
2016-12-07,45.5,0.0,73.7,14.4,"A stable weather pattern is anticipated from December 10 to December 14, 2016, with increased uncertainty due to smaller scale features in a flattened flow over the lower 48 states. There is good agreement on low pressure off the Pacific Northwest and a stationary front across the Northern Rockies. A frontal system is expected to develop in the Central Rockies and Plains, moving northeast towards the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes on December 11. Cold air intrusion and a surge of Arctic air will lead to below normal temperatures in the Northern Plains and regions to the east, while above normal temperatures will persist in the Desert Southwest through the weekend. 

Heavy precipitation is likely in Northern California and Western Oregon due to strong onshore flow and localized episodes of moisture, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, Northern Great Basin, and Northern Rockies, leading to valley rain and higher elevation snow. The weekend system may produce significant snowfall along its track, with lighter snowfall and modest rainfall in downstream areas. Local moisture and lift will be enhanced by Pacific impulses, increasing precipitation rates."

Significant precipitation associated with an upper low from the Pacific Northwest will diminish later this week. Precipitation will expand from Texas northeastward due to a lingering frontal boundary, with strong southerly flow from the Gulf. A significant temperature gradient of +/- 20°F is anticipated, with mixed precipitation types likely due to strong southerly flow at 850 hPa above northeast surface flow. Areas to the south will see rain while those to the north may experience snow, sleet, and freezing rain depending on boundary positions. A warming trend ahead of the cold front will bring temperatures into the 60s for the mid-Atlantic, 50s for the Northeast, and 40s for northern New England, potentially approaching record highs. This may raise concerns for ice impacts due to significant precipitation amounts. Cooler weather will follow the cold front for Texas eastward to Florida, with Florida remaining unaffected by the cooler temperatures."

Model agreement indicates the presence of a large-scale trough in the western U.S. and disturbances impacting the central plains and Ohio Valley. Stormy weather anticipated in the southern tier states, with a significant risk of severe weather and excessive rainfall, especially in Texas and Oklahoma midweek. 

Temperatures east of the Rockies will likely be above normal for late March, particularly from Texas to the Deep South, while cooler than average conditions are expected under the upper low in the Southwest and Northern New England. High dewpoints will limit overnight cooling, creating a humid feel similar to May. Warm overnight lows are expected in the South, contrasting with cooler temperatures in the Southwest and Northern New England, influenced by a Canadian high to the north."
2017-03-25,65.0,0.0,59.9,12.6,"Active weather pattern across North America, particularly in British Columbia and the U.S. Northwest. A split flow will bring low amplitude waves eastward, with partial phasing of northern and southern streams impacting southeastern Canada and the northeastern U.S. A frontal system will advance, developing a deepening surface low east of New England by day 4. Model spread increases, with ECMWF/UKMET/CMC being quicker than the slower GFS. 

A closed upper low crosses the Four Corners region on day 3, with differences in deamplification as it moves into the southeast. The GFS maintains a more amplified wave leading to a southern track, while EC and GEFS suggest quicker weakening and a northern track. Models converge on an upper trough moving into the Pacific Northwest by day 5, anticipated to amplify and push south, potentially forming a closed upper low by day 6. 

There is potential for excessive rainfall across the southern and central plains due to high humidity and impressive low-level moisture flux, leading to widespread convection and flash flooding on Wednesday and Thursday. Severe thunderstorms are possible from the southern plains to the lower Mississippi Valley. Showers and thunderstorms may affect the MS/OH valleys to the eastern U.S. on Friday and Saturday.

Temperatures will generally be near or above average across much of the continental U.S. Cooler maritime air may impact the Northeast and mid-Atlantic from Saturday to Monday. Below average temperatures are expected in the interior western U.S. by Thursday-Friday.

Partial phasing of northern and southern streams will lead to the formation of low-pressure systems in the North Atlantic, east of New England. A low is predicted to deepen south of the Canadian Maritimes, with models showing better agreement on its eastward movement. By Friday, there will be increased uncertainty as the system moves into the mid-Mississippi and Ohio valleys, transitioning into a mid/upper ridge axis across the eastern U.S. 

On Saturday, a coastal low is forecasted to develop and move east off the Mid-Atlantic coast. A significant shortwave will enter the Pacific Northwest Wednesday night, amplifying southeast, leading to an upper low near the Four Corners region by Friday. Initial minor timing differences between GFS and ECMWF models are expected, with the ECMWF suggesting a longer-lasting upper low that will weaken and progress northeast into the central U.S. by Sunday. A northern stream shortwave will approach the Northwest by day 7, but there is high uncertainty regarding timing. 

Expect substantial low/mid-level moisture flux across the southern and central plains, leading to heavy rainfall and potential severe thunderstorms. The Pacific Northwest could see heavy rain and high-elevation snow, with anomalous precipitable water expected to result in significant precipitation in the Great Basin/Intermountain West. Overall, temperatures will remain mild with near or above-average readings, alongside potential convection in the southern plains and lower Mississippi Valley.

Low pressure systems are expected to develop over the North Atlantic and possibly the Mid-Atlantic coast. Two significant weather systems are forecasted: one over the Southern/Central Plains and another originating from the Pacific Northwest moving southeast. 

Uncertainty exists regarding the timing of upper-level low developments, with the ECMWF model showing bias towards rapid phasing and movement, while the GFS model remains consistent. A slower progression of these systems is anticipated, particularly in the Northwest.

Enhanced moisture will lead to the potential for severe thunderstorms in the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast on Thursday. Heavy rain and snow are expected in the Interior West, with concentrated precipitation along the eastern slopes of the Colorado Rockies from Friday night into Saturday.

Temperatures will generally be near or above average across most of the CONUS, with potential incursions of cooler maritime air in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic late in the period. Below-average temperatures are likely in the Interior West on Thursday and Friday, extending into parts of the Southern/Central Plains by the weekend. As low pressure affects the Southern/Central Plains days 6-7, intense convection is possible due to moisture return from the Gulf of Mexico."

Overall, lower humidity and below-normal temperatures are anticipated from the Mississippi to the East Coast due to the upper trough, while ridging in the West correlates with above-normal temperatures."
2017-07-27,78.7,0.0,80.2,11.8,"Building ridge over the western U.S. indicates increasing temperatures, persisting through at least August 3. Downstream troughing may lead to variable precipitation, especially affecting the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic regions. Abundant monsoonal moisture will generate potential heavy convection from the southern Rockies eastward into the plains, with lower rainfall totals expected in the Southwest. Northern-Central Florida may experience heavy rain due to a wavy front, as well as sporadic convection along the Gulf and Southeast coasts. High temperatures will be well above normal (5-15°F) in Northern-Central California, Pacific Northwest, and Northern Rockies, while the Four Corners states and Central-Southern Plains may see highs at least 10°F below normal due to showers and thunderstorms.

Highs may exceed record temperatures by more than 5 degrees, particularly in Seattle, Portland, and Medford, resulting in readings 20 to 25 degrees above normal for early August. As the upper ridge weakens, temperatures will gradually decrease but remain warm throughout the period. In contrast, the central U.S. will be 10 to 15 degrees below average through Saturday due to lower heights. 

Precipitation will primarily affect the Gulf Coast, with heavy rainfall expected due to a stalled frontal boundary. Active monsoonal flow will increase chances for organized thunderstorms across the Desert Southwest and Four Corners region, potentially impacting adjacent areas of the Great Plains.

A shortwave is expected to dig into western Canada, evolving into an upper low west of Hudson Bay by Monday. The WPC forecast favors an EC/GEFS ensemble mean blend throughout the period, with contributions from the Canadian model at the start.

Expect meaningful rainfall from the system moving from the Great Lakes into the northeast. A cold front over the plains may trigger convection and lead to some heavy rainfall in parts of the central U.S. and pockets in the southeast. Monsoonal convection over the Four Corners will be lighter, with the highest totals confined to southern Mexico.

Models show good agreement on the large-scale pattern, although details regarding the upper low crossing Eastern Canada remain unclear. The 06Z GFS suggests quicker deepening of the upper low and a deeper surface low positioned slightly farther west. There's some variation noted in both GFS and ECMWF models, causing uncertainty in forecasts. The system moving from the Gulf of Alaska into Western Canada by midweek is now progressing slower than previously thought. Models indicate a weakening subtropical ridge over the Southeastern/South Central U.S. which may lead to a northward shift in the predicted track of Tropical Storm Harvey, though many solutions still suggest a westward trajectory.

A lead front is pushing offshore, followed by a cooling high pressure system. Potential precipitation is expected from a series of waves along the front, impacting the central US and mid-Atlantic/southeast next week. There is good continuity in the forecast for Sunday/Monday, but model solutions diverge for days 5-7 concerning the amplitude and timing of trough energy patterns. The 00 UTC GFS is more progressive than the 00 UTC ECMWF, whereas the 06 UTC GFS is less progressive than the ECMWF. The 00 UTC UKMET, Canadian models, and some ensemble members suggest a potential for a more pinched/offshore closed low in the northeastern Pacific. Medium-range forecasts for surfaces fronts and pressures primarily utilize ensemble means to minimize variability, with potential shortwave lows possibly developing further than current predictions, favoring the ECMWF ensemble mean for flow amplitude maintenance."

The Gulf Coast, Southeast, and Florida can expect showers and thunderstorms throughout the weekend. Most of the country will experience above normal temperatures during this period, except for Florida, which will see below normal temperatures due to cloudiness and rainfall. Temperatures are expected to dip below normal in the Northeast on Thursday but will recover to near normal by Friday and continue through the weekend."
2018-05-21,73.8,0.0,64.8,14.1,"Heavy rain is possible from Florida into the Southeast and southern Appalachians due to troughing in the West and Labrador Sea. Persistent upper troughing is expected to move north from the central Gulf of Mexico into the lower MS Valley, with uncertainty regarding a northern stream's impact on the Northeast's weather patterns. 

Increased rainfall is anticipated in the northern Plains and areas from the lower MS Valley through the Southeast, including Florida, with locally moderate to heavy rainfall possible. The northward flow of moisture aloft suggests higher humidity levels in these areas. A frontal system is developing over the northern Plains, impacting precipitation and humidity across the Southeast and Florida.

Above-normal temperatures are forecast for much of the lower 48, except for cooler temperatures in the Southeast and Florida due to clouds and rainfall, as well as in California and the Great Basin influenced by an upper low from the eastern Pacific.

A cold front will impact southern Canada on Friday and Saturday. A developing tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico shows varied model predictions on strength and placement. The GFS and ECMWF models indicate a stronger western U.S. closed low. Confidence in forecast outcomes is tempered due to guidance variability, with faster trends noted, especially for the upper low moving into the West. The upper low's path has shifted southeast but not as much as earlier UKMET runs suggested. Recent model divergence is evident, particularly with the ECMWF indicating a southwest shift. Indications suggest the western upper low may slow its movement by early next week. The northern Plains may see dampening of associated surface low pressure, leading to high pressure over New England. Potential low-pressure formation in the northwest Caribbean and southern U.S. remains uncertain, with a likelihood of heavier rainfall across the southern/eastern U.S. due to moisture flow related to the upper trough and recent heavy rainfall areas. Expect persistent warmth in the northern Plains/upper Mississippi Valley, with temps more than 10F above normal, while the Southeast will have below-normal highs due to clouds and rain. Cooling trends are likely in New England and the Mid-Atlantic by early next week.

Two model predictions exist for a Gulf low-pressure system: one suggesting a northwesterly track towards the Mississippi River, and another indicating a more northerly route across Florida. Confidence in the forecast remains moderate due to the variability in model guidance. In the western U.S., an upper low is anticipated to drift east-northeast, producing locally heavy rain in the Great Basin and northern Rockies, with additional shortwave energy impacting the northern Great Lakes.

Temperatures in the central U.S. are forecasted to be well above average, with high temperature anomalies of +10 to +20°F expected from Saturday to Monday, particularly in the northern Plains and Upper Midwest.

An amplified flow pattern is present with a blocking ridge over the Bering Sea and a persistent upper low in northern Canada. Hurricane Florence's track remains uncertain but may approach the East Coast by Wednesday-Thursday. 

Model consensus shows good agreement on the track of Gordon but large discrepancies regarding Florence. A frontal system will enter the northern Plains by Sunday, dissipating as it travels north into Canada. Cooling temperatures in the Northwest will yield highs 5-10°F below normal, while northern Plains locations may see highs 10-15°F above normal. Central-southern Plains and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast regions are expected to experience below normal daytime highs of 10-15°F on Sunday, followed by a trend towards normalization by Tuesday-Thursday, with minimum temperatures above normal in the East. 

Precipitation is likely to persist in the Pacific Northwest, particularly on Vancouver Island, while most measurable rain remains north of California. Brisk winds may occur in coastal areas depending on Florence's track, necessitating close monitoring of evolving weather patterns. Rainfall amounts are anticipated to decrease moving into the Northeast as moisture from Gordon shifts."
2018-09-07,80.0,2.614,73.6,12.6,"Heavy rainfall will exit the Northeast early next week, primarily affecting New England before diminishing. The remnants of Hurricane Gordon will move across Lake Erie. Hurricane Florence is anticipated off the East Coast with possible coastal and inland effects depending on its track, which remains uncertain. Significant height rises will occur across the central and eastern U.S., leading to warmer temperatures in those areas. The period from September 12-14 will see a longwave trough over the eastern Pacific and West Coast, with cool temperatures forecasted 5 to 10 degrees below normal in northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Multiple low-pressure systems will bring rainfall to the north-central U.S., while heavy rainfall remains a threat around the western Gulf Coast due to ongoing weather systems. Initial warm conditions are expected due to the upper ridge, and flooding rains and high winds are possible with Hurricane Florence, though specific impacts remain uncertain."
2018-09-08,71.1,0.239,86.7,19.7,"Florence is likely to impact the East Coast next week, with significant weather developments anticipated in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic from late Wednesday onwards. The hurricane is expected to strengthen between the Bahamas and the Outer Banks, remaining a couple hundred miles off South Carolina according to the 00Z ECMWF model. Heavy rain is expected in the East, with potential amounts of 5-10 inches over a few days due to ongoing tropical fetch. Coastal flooding, storm surge, and damaging winds are risks for coastal and inland areas. Winds may increase due to aging patterns. Temperatures will be generally cooler than average in the Northwest and near to above average elsewhere, with minimum temperatures in the East potentially reaching record warm values. Several inches of rain are also possible in the northern and northwestern Gulf Coast due to a weakness aloft and abundant moisture."
